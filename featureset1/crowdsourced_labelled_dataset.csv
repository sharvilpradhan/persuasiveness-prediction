*First, one can simply refrain from creating accounts on social media sites(facebook, twitter, pinterest, etc).  This would quickly increase your privacy.  You can even retain some privacy by being judicious with your posts.

*If you want even more privacy you can use to [tor](https://www.torproject.org/).  This system accesses a network of servers that makes your internet activity virtually impossible to track.

*There are also companies out there, such as [abine](http://abine.com/) that can track the availability of your personal information and can even remove much of it for a price.

*On license plates, there are many people who do not have a car and thus no license plate number.

*You can also encrypt your hard drive.  Modern cryptography is quite effective and, if done correctly, cannot be cracked in any reasonable amount of time(read &lt; 1,000,000 years) even using the best super computers available today.  This has become a problem for law enforcement and a US supreme court case was held on the subject(they ruled that you can be legally compelled to decrypt your hard drive).

Using the above methods one can achieve a considerable amount of privacy, at least from casual people.  If we were to go further into legal protections you could do the following.

*Ban the use of social security numbers by private institutions or most government agencies.  Bills that would implement such measures have appeared from time to time, for the purpose of improved privacy.

*Require companies to obtain your express consent before posting information on your relationships, criminal records, family tree etc.

*Prohibit the storage of browsing history by ISPs.

That would not increase your privacy, only make it slightly harder for someone to find out things about you. Most of the information you put on social media sites is already available and known about you even if you don't put it there yourself.

&gt;If you want even more privacy you can use to tor.

While this does give you some online privacy, you still don't have privacy outside your online activity. Most of the information about you (you name, your age, your current and past place of residence, your employment history, etc. the list goes VERY long) is already pretty easily available, so while you might not reveal what you do online, most of the <&quot;>important<&quot;> privacy is already out there.

&gt;There are also companies out there, such as abine that can track the availability of your personal information and can even remove much of it for a price.

That's a scam. They can't really remove most of the personal information about you. They can sometimes remove a public page or website listing, they cannot force a company that has info about you to delete that information from their database. The company can choose to publish that information again later, or even sell it (or access to it) to some other entity, making it available again.

&gt;You can also encrypt your hard drive

You may want to do that, but I don't think those are going to happen (not any time soon, at least).

Moreover, information doesn't get deleted from the internet. Most of the things that are on the internet are cached and mirrored in multiple places. Even if you do get the companies to remove or not publish information about you, that information will still probably be somewhere, be it something like archive.org, or some cache dump that a lot of companies make, or a lot of other means.

Not exactly. The point of <&quot;>privacy is dead<&quot;> is not that there is no more privacy to be invaded, it's that **most** of your privacy, the important things, stuff like who you are, what you did, who you know, where you've been are largely known by now, so it doesn't matter if you can still have little details private, as the important stuff is no longer private.

&gt; Our thoughts are still private.

Good point. That would be a huge step up, and that **WOULD** be a concern, but I don't think it's realistic to <&quot;>read minds<&quot;> yet (and I don't think that will be in our lifetimes) so while that's not an option, I don't think *that* is something we need to worry about.. yet.

&gt; What we see is still largely private

What do you mean by that? If you mean what you're looking at, well if you are in a <&quot;>public<&quot;> (or someone else's private) place, there's a good chance there's a camera recording you, knowing what you looked at is as simple as calculating (or even estimating) the angle of your eyes. 

Eye tracing is not only possible, it's gotten so easy and cheap, there are [consumer products](http://mirametrix.com/products/eye-tracker/) using it.

&gt; What we say in person, to someone who is trustworthy, with no eavesdroppers or recordings, is still largely private.

First of all, while this is usually true, I wouldn't rely on it. Computers are easily hackable, ~~staxnet~~ (I actually meant [Flame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_%28malware%29) here) already showed how easy it is to record <&quot;>secret conversations<&quot;>. Cellphone (and smartphones in particular) are getting hacked more and more (and I don't see this trend slowing down) so if someone really wants to hear what you say, it's not impossible.

Even forgetting that, you can go back to the cameras, while most are still just video, more and more surveillance cameras are getting sound recording capabilities.

Second, and more importantly, this is not the kind of privacy I'm talking about. I'm talking about the bigger stuff, as I mentioned, stuff like who you are and where you are and where you've been.

For example, at one part of the video he talks about how easily Italian investigators were able to reconstruct the movement of CIA operatives on a secret abduction mission in Italy using simple cellphone records, the same records that cellphone companies collect for every single cellphone. He also talks about ways to do that even if someone uses a burner or no cellphone at all using a combination of other people's phones, cameras and more.

Our military is primarily minorities because it is viewed as one of the few ways to escape 'the hood.'  To them the military isn't <&quot;>an option<&quot;> it's <&quot;>the option that isn't jail.<&quot;>  This means the people who you WANT to have these hard emotional experiences are people who don't want to be there anyway.

As you say, 2 people suffer every time a soldier kills a combatant.  The combatant suffers death, and the soldier suffers trauma.  If the soldier is sent to a place where he must kill, or be killed, he will suffer IMMENSE trauma to his psyche.  This isn't some vicious killing machine, this is some poor soul trying to escape the ghetto... and despite the option of reducing the number of people who suffer per kill from 2-1, you WANT the soldier to suffer.

It also states that the progeny of alcoholic parents are likely to develop addiction towards alcohol. I believe there is a practical concern in exercising free will and harming oneself rather one must develop self-control and imbibe healthy life-style changes to reduce alcohol addiction.,4
1c3mds,c9cplvm,1c3mds,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=_dJ97Vwoup4

I recommend watching the documentary, it does a great job actually showing the effect alcoholism has on families while briefly touching upon the concept of addiction.  

Now, onto my on counter-argument: It's rare that someone becomes an alcoholic after drinking a few times.  It usually takes a while and typically dependence on alcohol develops before an addiction.  So let me try to explain the concept of dependence: in your brain, there are receptors for substances.  As you begin to drink more and more, the receptors for alcohol begin to become constantly occupied, and it thus takes more and more of the substance to get the same effect as before (this is the idea behind tolerance).  You then begin to crave alcohol, and you then continue to have to drink more and more to feel intoxicated.  As I said earlier, in the brain, there are receptors for all sorts of substances.  Alcohol interacts with a lot of difference receptors and several things end up happening: the dopamine, GABA, glutamate, endorphin and other systems are all affected (those are all neurotransmitters, chemicals released in our body).  Of particular importance is the dopamine system-dopamine is a neurotransmitter and when we drink dopamine is released in the reward pathway in our brain-this is what makes drinking feel good.  

So as you can see, there are a lot of changes in our brain systems and pathways that happen when you drink.  It isnÇƒˆ?—?•t just a lack of self-control-there are actual neurological changes happening in the brain that make it extremely difficult to just stop drinking.  

For a more scientific explanation, see these links:
http://www.alcohol-drug.com/biology.htm
http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA77/AA77.pdf

Also, it is extremely difficult to get out of an addiction unless you change your lifestyle-if you are still around the same people, stressors, bars that previously encouraged you to drink, it is highly likely that you will start to drink again.  

Sorry for all the links, IÇƒˆ?—?•m an undergraduate in Psychology so I donÇƒˆ?—?•t feel too confident in my explanation being exactly clear and IÇƒˆ?—?•m hoping that these links will help to clarify some points better.  

 
EDIT: some grammar and such.  I also want to point out that the reason some people become alcoholics while others don't is really complex and involved interactions between our genes and our environment (which includes how we were raised and various social factors).  You can kind of make a comparison to mental illness here, for example, in the Diathesis-Stress model of Mental illness which basically states that if you have a predisposition (through genes) to certain illnesses and disease does not necessarily mean that you will express said disease.  But various stressors in your life interact with this predisposition, and this sometimes results in expressing things such as schizophrenia, depression, addiction, ect.

I recommend watching the documentary, it does a great job actually showing the effect alcoholism has on families while briefly touching upon the concept of addiction.  

Now, onto my on counter-argument: It's rare that someone becomes an alcoholic after drinking a few times.  It usually takes a while and typically dependence on alcohol develops before an addiction.  So let me try to explain the concept of dependence: in your brain, there are receptors for substances.  As you begin to drink more and more, the receptors for alcohol begin to become constantly occupied, and it thus takes more and more of the substance to get the same effect as before (this is the idea behind tolerance).  You then begin to crave alcohol, and you then continue to have to drink more and more to feel intoxicated.  As I said earlier, in the brain, there are receptors for all sorts of substances.  Alcohol interacts with a lot of difference receptors and several things end up happening: the dopamine, GABA, glutamate, endorphin and other systems are all affected (those are all neurotransmitters, chemicals released in our body).  Of particular importance is the dopamine system-dopamine is a neurotransmitter and when we drink dopamine is released in the reward pathway in our brain-this is what makes drinking feel good.  

So as you can see, there are a lot of changes in our brain systems and pathways that happen when you drink.  It isn‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•t just a lack of self-control-there are actual neurological changes happening in the brain that make it extremely difficult to just stop drinking.  

For a more scientific explanation, see these links:
http://www.alcohol-drug.com/biology.htm
http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA77/AA77.pdf

Also, it is extremely difficult to get out of an addiction unless you change your lifestyle-if you are still around the same people, stressors, bars that previously encouraged you to drink, it is highly likely that you will start to drink again.  

Sorry for all the links, I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•m an undergraduate in Psychology so I don‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•t feel too confident in my explanation being exactly clear and I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•m hoping that these links will help to clarify some points better.  

 
EDIT: some grammar and such.  I also want to point out that the reason some people become alcoholics while others don't is really complex and involved interactions between our genes and our environment (which includes how we were raised and various social factors).  You can kind of make a comparison to mental illness here, for example, in the Diathesis-Stress model of Mental illness which basically states that if you have a predisposition (through genes) to certain illnesses and disease does not necessarily mean that you will express said disease.  But various stressors in your life interact with this predisposition, and this sometimes results in expressing things such as schizophrenia, depression, addiction, ect.

Disease is a broad term. A cold is a disease, but it is not on par with cancer. Also, keep in mind that if someone has a heavy enough drinking problem and quit cold turkey, they can die from withdrawal. It's not usually that serious, but there is a life threatening aspect to it.

&gt;Help me understand why this is a disease and not a lack of self-&gt;control.

Why can't it be both? It seems like your problem with it is that unlike most diseases, with alcoholism, it is the choice to drink or not drink that you have a problem with. In principle, I kinda agree with you but there are some other aspects to keep in mind. Different people have different genetic makeups that make them more or less prone to different diseases, like cancer, diabetes, etc. So some people can drink like a motherfucker and never get addicted, while others are easily susceptible. When you get addicted to alcohol (or any other drug) you're brain's chemistry changes and alcohol because a major, or main priority. It is a control issue, but that does not make it not a disease.

&gt;I feel like some people just use the label <&quot;>alcoholic<&quot;> so they do not &gt;feel responsible for their actions and blame their brain chemistry.

If I understand you correctly, you don't think that brain chemistry constitutes disease. If you feel that way, then you have to discount all mental health. ADD, ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar, etc are all brain chemistry issues.",Adrenalchrome,CC,5,,1

[<&quot;>Disease<&quot;> is a complicated term. This is an excellent article about it.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/)

&gt;<&quot;>Disease<&quot;> suggests that certain characteristics always come together. A rough sketch of some of the characteristics we expect in a disease might include:

&gt;1. Something caused by the sorts of thing you study in biology: proteins, bacteria, ions, viruses, genes.

&gt;2. Something involuntary and completely immune to the operations of free will
3. Something rare; the vast majority of people don't have it
4. Something unpleasant; when you have it, you want to get rid of it
5. Something discrete; a graph would show two widely separate populations, one with the disease and one without, and not a normal distribution.
6. Something commonly treated with science-y interventions like chemicals and radiation.

&gt;Cancer satisfies every one of these criteria, and so we have no qualms whatsoever about classifying it as a disease. 

&gt; Obesity arguably sort-of-satisfies criteria (1), (4), and (6), but it would be pretty hard to make a case for (2), (3), and (5).

&gt;So, is obesity really a disease? Well, is Pluto really a planet? Once we state that obesity satisfies some of the criteria but not others, it is meaningless to talk about an additional fact of whether it <&quot;>really deserves to be a disease<&quot;> or not.

And that would be all she wrote, except that humans have this terrible tendency to make value judgments based on whether something <&quot;>is really a disease or not<&quot;>. The two main judgments we make are <&quot;>do they deserve sympathy?<&quot;> and <&quot;>is it right to treat medically?<&quot;>. 

&gt;If something is a real disease, the patient deserves our sympathy and support; for example, cancer sufferers must universally be described as <&quot;>brave<&quot;>. If it is not a real disease, people are more likely to get our condemnation; for example Sandy's husband who calls her a <&quot;>pig<&quot;> for her inability to control her eating habits. The difference between <&quot;>shyness<&quot;> and <&quot;>social anxiety disorder<&quot;> is that people with the first get called <&quot;>weird<&quot;> and told to man up, and people with the second get special privileges and the sympathy of those around them.

&gt;And if something is a real disease, it is socially acceptable (maybe even mandated) to seek medical treatment for it. If it's not a disease, medical treatment gets derided as a <&quot;>quick fix<&quot;> or an <&quot;>abdication of personal responsibility<&quot;>. I have talked to several doctors who are uncomfortable suggesting gastric bypass surgery, even in people for whom it is medically indicated, because they believe it is morally wrong to turn to medicine to solve a character issue.

1c3mds,c9cxq43,1c3mds,"First, my condolences. I too have seen alcoholism (in friends, not in relatives, so your position might be even more painful) and it's not a pretty sight. Onto changing your mind...

[<&quot;>Disease<&quot;> is a complicated term. This is an excellent article about it.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2as/diseased_thinking_dissolving_questions_about/)

&gt;<&quot;>Disease<&quot;> suggests that certain characteristics always come together. A rough sketch of some of the characteristics we expect in a disease might include:

&gt;1. Something caused by the sorts of thing you study in biology: proteins, bacteria, ions, viruses, genes.

&gt;2. Something involuntary and completely immune to the operations of free will
3. Something rare; the vast majority of people don't have it
4. Something unpleasant; when you have it, you want to get rid of it
5. Something discrete; a graph would show two widely separate populations, one with the disease and one without, and not a normal distribution.
6. Something commonly treated with science-y interventions like chemicals and radiation.

&gt;Cancer satisfies every one of these criteria, and so we have no qualms whatsoever about classifying it as a disease. 

&gt; Obesity arguably sort-of-satisfies criteria (1), (4), and (6), but it would be pretty hard to make a case for (2), (3), and (5).

&gt;So, is obesity really a disease? Well, is Pluto really a planet? Once we state that obesity satisfies some of the criteria but not others, it is meaningless to talk about an additional fact of whether it <&quot;>really deserves to be a disease<&quot;> or not.

And that would be all she wrote, except that humans have this terrible tendency to make value judgments based on whether something <&quot;>is really a disease or not<&quot;>. The two main judgments we make are <&quot;>do they deserve sympathy?<&quot;> and <&quot;>is it right to treat medically?<&quot;>. 

&gt;If something is a real disease, the patient deserves our sympathy and support; for example, cancer sufferers must universally be described as <&quot;>brave<&quot;>. If it is not a real disease, people are more likely to get our condemnation; for example Sandy's husband who calls her a <&quot;>pig<&quot;> for her inability to control her eating habits. The difference between <&quot;>shyness<&quot;> and <&quot;>social anxiety disorder<&quot;> is that people with the first get called <&quot;>weird<&quot;> and told to man up, and people with the second get special privileges and the sympathy of those around them.

&gt;And if something is a real disease, it is socially acceptable (maybe even mandated) to seek medical treatment for it. If it's not a disease, medical treatment gets derided as a <&quot;>quick fix<&quot;> or an <&quot;>abdication of personal responsibility<&quot;>. I have talked to several doctors who are uncomfortable suggesting gastric bypass surgery, even in people for whom it is medically indicated, because they believe it is morally wrong to turn to medicine to solve a character issue.

Now, I need your input. Do either of these questions seem like the real reason behind why you don't want to call alcoholism a disease? If so, which one?",shokwave,CC,3,The author makes a weak attempt to classify diseases based on general inference. Every condition that fits the criteria is categorized as a disease or else no. On these grounds the validity of referring to conditions like obesity and alcohol as a disease is questioned. The two main judgements are i) do they deserve sympathy? and ii) Is it right to treat medically? which are not credible and not substantiated.,4

1c3mds,c9d62cd,1c3mds,"Let me tell you about my trip through alcoholism and back to normal drinking levels. 

I moved to a new town where I didn't know anybody directly after college. Started working and tried going out to bars to meet people. It being an area MUCH different from where I grew up it took me a long time of going to bars Friday, Saturday, and any events I could find to find a bar where I fit in. Then when I met people I didn't hang out with them outside the bar because all they did was go to that particular bar and work and it was hard to find outside interests. So what to do with my weeknights? I guess I started doing nothing but playing games, watching streams, and watching tv. When that got boring I didn't think it was a big deal to have a drink or two while I played. Two turned into three. Three turned into 7. Over the course of six months I went from having a college type drinking spree once a month to drinking more than I drank in college every day. I was drinking when I went to the bars because I was at the bar. I was drinking at home because I had nothing else to do. Eventually I went to the doctor to find that I had gained over 40 pounds. I decided to cut back severely on my drinking, as logically cutting out the majority of my fat intake was the best way to stop the weight gain. 

This was the second hardest thing I have ever done (the hardest being quitting smoking). I fell into a deep depression unable to fall asleep or wake up in the morning. I would try to game and be distracted to the point of sweating. My brain was telling me that just one more drink, just one, and I would be fine. I would be able to get through it. It's more than just telling you, it tricks you. <&quot;>We've been doing so good we deserve a treat,<&quot;> <&quot;>Well you still have that rum left, no sense letting it go to waste,<&quot;> <&quot;>Quitting cold turkey is hard for ANYBODY there's no shame in going and having a couple shots to take the edge off.<&quot;> Every reason you can think of, no matter how illogical, my brain would come up with to try and get me to drink again. 

I will say that I didn't break and I made it through and I can drink again without feeling like I HAVE to drink though sometimes I still get the feeling like my stomach is falling out from under me and it's SO tempting to go and get a glass and drink at a completely inappropriate time. 

What I'm saying is that the progression to drinking heavily like that happens in a way that feels natural. You just keep upping the ante little by little till you're so far over the edge that you can't see the shore. If I didn't hate the idea of me being fat more than I hate anything else in this world I wouldn't have made it and I can understand people who actually have trouble overcoming that.",Thenre,CC,2,Not an argument,1

One could easily make the argument that those bubbles wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the government getting involved and creating false signals into the economy of that is where people should put their money into.

The contrast being the Government coming in to regulate it would in fact send more bad market signals that may disrupt the natural flow of the economy even more so.

&gt;Fundamentally, this hypothesis also assumes that people are rational. People are irrational and emotional, by their very nature.

Free Market Economics assumes that everybody is an irrational actor, but allows for the individual to determine the actual value of the products and services. But ultimately since everyone is acting in their best interest, then the most people's needs could be efficiently met.

&gt;I do believe that some, very small markets can be efficient, but in general, most markets are not.

Larger markets incorporates the factors of countless smaller markets and ultimately becomes interdependent... but there is a limit to how much information is available. That is why we are living in what people call the information age... because we are only now quantifying countless data points and considerations, but with perfect knowledge, comes perfect marketing models.

Ah ha! I think we're using different sets of assumptions.

Pretty much. You work with the assumption that artificial prices are already worked in and hedged against, where as I hold the former true, but not every company hedges against a possibly bad bet. As to the efficiency of this... well it has proven to be the most efficient way to make money (and lose).

But yes, we fundamentally agree on the core issue: Timing.

&gt;I'd say one of the very first bubbles in recorded history was created by the free market, more or less. (An aside - If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it.)

You are 100% right. We both agree that bubbles are a bad thing... but the question is:
Would said bubble exist in a world of perfect information? I'd argue no. The bubble exists because of limited information. But due to this limitation... it is the most efficient way to look at it. But nobody wants to jump off of a bull market too soon (Till it is too late).

&gt;Maybe this is a misunderstanding on my part of the EMH, but I thought that if the market were efficient, then there wouldn't need to be a correction. I mean, yes, I think you could argue that the price was correct at the time, with the given information, and then new information came and adjusted the price downward very rapidly. But, I would counter that by reverting back to my position about the difference between good and bad information.

You are 100% right. But one can counter that by saying the information was good till new good information came in. Information of events and pressures that weren't considered in the first place.

&gt;Perhaps they have more/better information?

With that much power and influence, they have better information and have smarter people working for them.

As to the price of any product or commodity... it is simply what people are willing to pay at that time with all the given information. Price is an indicator in itself of the value of the information that helped set that price initially. Or... like you said before...

1cc8c7,caewjdb,c9fk04o,"More liquid markets, by definition, are more efficient. 

Investment Risk is defined in many ways, but often as the sum of several different types of risks. One of these is liquidity risk - the idea that if I had to dump my entire position instantly, I would (not) be able to do so without drastically moving the price from its current value. In finance/trading terms this is often referred to as slippage. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippage_(finance)

Efficiency, in this context, is defined as being able to execute your buy at the same price at which you would be able to sell. Being able to freely move in and out of a position without slippage allows for lower barriers to trade. 

This can be illustrated in two very common ways. 

1) When you try to buy stock in a large company with a lot of volume, you can often buy millions of dollars in that company without moving the price of the stock at all. People buy millions of dollars of AAPL stock every day, with zero slippage. Because the market is more liquid, there is someone on the other side to sell you stock. This leads to greater efficiency. If you tried to buy $1mm of a small company at once, you would drastically move the price of that stock. Fewer dollars on the other side means you need to <&quot;>pay up<&quot;> to find willing sellers. 

2) Bid/Ask spreads. You buy at someone else's asking price, and you sell at someone else's bid price. The spread is the range between the bid and the ask. In liquid markets, the bid/ask spread is narrower. (The bid/ask in BAC stock is often 1 cent.) In less liquid markets, it is greater. 

So let's say I wanted to buy stock of company XYZ. XYZ is illiquid. A potential seller is asking $2.15/share. A buyer is asking $2.00/share. The bid/ask spread is 15 cents. (This happened in a specific stock yesterday.) So I need to buy stock from the seller at 2.15. If I wanted to sell it 5 seconds later, the best offer is from the potential buyer at 2.00. I lost 15 cents and the company hasn't changed at all. How is that efficient? The barrier to trade for me is now not only my required rate of return, but actually my required rate of return plus the spread. This causes less trade in illiquid stocks. Less trade is less efficient.",jokeheads,CC,3,,1

To start off, I would like to make clear that I do not believe in any variety of supernatural deity, but I feel that, if you assume that such a deity exists, Hick's response to the problem of evil holds up well. Given that one rejects the notion of a God on the basis of the problem of evil, but does not have a problem with the other aspects of religious faith (such as the necessity for faith itself, for example), this response would be adequate. Keep in mind that I am not asserting that Hick's response proves that a God exists, simply that Hick provides a satisfying solution to this specific theological problem and nothing else.

For the three people in the world who don't know, the problem of evil is as follows: 


1. If an all-powerful and perfectly good god exists, then evil does not.

2. There is evil in the world.

3. Therefore, an all-powerful and perfectly good god does not exist.

Hick responds to this by suggesting that evil is a necessity for the ascension of man. It is better to earn something through hard work and personal growth rather than simply being ascribed it, similar to how we view people who <&quot;>pulled themselves up by their bootstraps<&quot;> in a more positive light than we view people born into money. By enduring and responding to evil, we grow and become virtuous in a way that is impossible if we were simply granted these attributes. 

A question that is always raised when this species of discussion occurs is the problem of why bad things happen to good people (so much so that nearly and entire book of the bible deals with solving this problem). Hick responds by asserting that, if bad things only happened to bad people, people would be good only because they did not want to risk divine punishment rather than doing so because being good is good in itself, negating the lessons and growth prompted by evil in the first place. 

A less common response to Hick is that, while *some* evil may be necessary, far too terrible and far too much evil is present in the world for Hick's argument to justify it. Hick responds by suggesting that the human perception of evil is a matter of relativity. If the most evil thing in the universe that humans know of, say EVIL^X, were removed, the second most evil thing, EVIL^X-1 would now be perceived as just as bad an evil as EVIL^X, and so on, until we arrive at EVIL^0, that is, no evil at all, interfering with the creation of the goodly people. 

My view is that this response is adequate in solving the problem of evil, given the assumption that God exists. Attempt to change it at your leisure, if you are so inclined.

Isn't this the entire premise of heaven and hell? Aren't they supposed to be a divine reward/punishment for being good/bad? If god doesn't want people to be good out of fear of divine consequences, then why create heaven and hell? 

And if this were true, then shouldn't we also apply this reasoning to our laws? Laws also create rewards and punishments for good and bad behavior. If god doesn't want people to behave morally out of fear of consequences, then we should get rid of all of our laws, since trying to influence moral behavior with punishment goes against god's will.

This is a red herring. It doesn't address the initial assertion that some evil is unnecessary.

One of my issue with defenses of the problem of evil is that it raises the question of why god holds man to a higher moral standard than himself. If god, an all powerful and morally perfect being, is not obligated to stop evil, then why should humans, who are of limited power and morally imperfect, be obligated to do so? This would be like expecting children to be the moral leaders instead of the adults. It makes no sense. The only other reason I can think of for why god wouldn't prevent evil is if life is merely a test that separates good people from bad people, which is inconsistent with an all powerful god, who would not only know which people are good or bad without such a test, but would also have the power to create only good people who would pass such a test. I'm not sure why a perfectly good god would create someone who can't pass his test, then punish them for all eternity for not passing the test.

You don't have to believe in Heaven or Hell or Hick's response to be applicable. You can eliminate such a concept entirely from the problem of evil and not affect it in the slightest, so I'm inclined to say that it is irrelevant. 

&gt; And if this were true, then shouldn't we also apply this reasoning to our laws? Laws also create rewards and punishments for good and bad behavior. If god doesn't want people to behave morally out of fear of consequences, then we should get rid of all of our laws, since trying to influence moral behavior with punishment goes against god's will.

If everyone who contributes to the law making process truly accepted Hick's assertions, than yes. This isn't the case, though.",294116002,RE,4,,7

1d7g4o,c9nwpbl,1d7g4o,"Many problems with all this.

(1) Most obviously if god is all powerful then god could simply create people in an ascended state to begin with whatever that means.  Indeed any religion that says infants or babies who die get to go to heaven or whatever, clearly already believes this happens a lot.

(2) The principle itself just isn't true.

&gt; By enduring and responding to evil, we grow and become virtuous

Generally this just doesn't happen.  If it did then wouldn't we all be virtuous by now?  You see a lot of virtue around?  

(2a) If it worked then people who have suffered a lot would be the most virtuous.  This is false.

(2b) Can we agree that generally people who lived a long time ago had a lot more nasty shit happen to them?  Does that mean that people in the 1800s were more moral than people today?  Even though they were far more racist, sexist, prejudiced in all sorts of ways and felt OK with slavery?

(2c) On the contrary society's morals have increased as life has got easier.

(2d) I will concede that rich people (subject to the least pain) are less moral than the middle class, but at the same time being subjected to poverty often thrusts people towards a more violent, prejudiced and criminal life style.  This is not what the theory would predict.

(2e) Are older people more moral than the young?  They ought to be if this theory is right because they already lived through a lifetime of god's training program.  Older people tend to be much more prejudicial eg on gay rights issues.

(3) Even if it was true that pain creates virtue, the theory doesn't explain the pattern of the distribution of pain

If pain is god's training program then it ought to be more evenly distributed.  What is the point of having some go through life without much pain.  That would be counter-productive.  This theory would predict a particular pattern of the distribution of pain that is simply nothing like that which is observed.  For example if someone had a very painful childhood then logically they learned to be virtuous at an early age and don't need repeat lessons.  Contrariwise children born to an easy life would require extra pain in later life to catch up.

We see the opposite.  People with shitty childhoods are mostly those born into poverty and their future as an adult will in all likelihood continue to be more shitty than average.  In a sense the theory predicts a sort of over-one-lifetime Karma level like that TV program, *My Name Is Earl*.  But we know life is not like this.

So god is arbitrarily giving some people a lot more training than others.  This seems unfair and is the original problem now revealed to be unsolved.  It could be argued that some people need extra training as they were extra evil to begin with.  That begs the question if god can make people initially of varying levels of virtue why not make everyone start at the top?  (similar to objection (1) ).  But let's ignore that for now.  If this was the explanation then god could stop training as soon as a person was virtuous enough.  That would mean that pain wouldn't happen to good people.  But it does.  In fact this is (again) right back to the original problem which is revealed as not solved at all.

&gt; Hick responds by asserting that, if bad things only happened to bad people, people would be good only because they did not want to risk divine punishment

This is no answer because the whole theory says this training creates virtue.  Well does it work or does it not?  If it works then the people who have been subjected to the pain and have become virtuous as a result are virtuous.  By definition then they do not do good merely for fear of punishment.  

(4) Inflicting pain to create virtue is immoral

Let's assume it's all true.  Pain creates virtue.  Why then should we not all be subjecting other to as much pain as possible so that they will become virtuous?  Doesn't that sound sensible?  No of course it sounds monstrous and many religions (all of them?) specifically say do not do this.   But why?

1d7g4o,c9nx2i8,c9nn6r1,"&gt; One thing I'll say is that, while I agree with the point about the relativity of what's evil, evil is not fairly distributed. If evil exists to help man grow, then it doesn't make sense that many first world cultures can go through life with very little to no evil impacting them, while third world culture put up with all sorts of things. Because of this uneven distribution, evil doesn't really help people in that way.
Another point is that evil very often doesn't improve anything. Many innocent people die as a result. How has this made them better people? They weren't given a choice in the matter.

Even if suffering in unequal amounts is better for man's ascension, the same people suffering all the time doesn't, evidently, help.

&gt;I'm fairly certain, though I may be mistaken, that Hick makes the assumption that God cannot preform any action that is tautologically impossible. It would be able to create universes, turn lead into gold, etcetera, but would not be able to create a square circle or have X = Y where X does not equal Y.

Hick does this but basically I've always seen it as a cop out. Omnipotent means all-powerful, and all Hick does here is create and apply his own personal definition to it and expect people to go along with it. Hick defines omnipotence as <&quot;>all powerful within logic<&quot;> in this case, but just because he uses that definition doesn't make it true. Unless I've missed it (a good chance, admittedly, as Hick is not someone I've given huge amount of attention to) he never explains in a good way why his definition should be accepted and why we shouldn't use the definition of <&quot;>unlimited power<&quot;> when referring to God. I've never found his reasoning of <&quot;>God is omnipotent, but only if omnipotent means *this*<&quot;> as something that aids his argument.",Ultra-ChronicMonstah,CC,3,,2

That's just special pleading. God can either do everything or he can't.

I'm taking this from a user in /r/DebateReligion, but I don't remember their name so if someone gets buggered enough to have me find the user then I will.

Let's say that there are two <&quot;>definitions<&quot;> omnipotence:

Omnipotence A is the ability to do anything, including those things that are logically impossible (e.g. make a married bachelor).

Omnipotence B is the ability to do anything that is logically possible.

Omnipotence A is obviously nonsense - how can a God create a rock so heavy that they can't lift it? It immediately invalidates the omnipotence trait. Omnipotence B is not looking so good either, given that the deity is generally believed to have created everything in existence. Not many would argue that God can not be bound by anything that he has created. But wait a minute, if God created everything in existence, then that means he created logic as well, unless we are stating that logic is outside of existence and beyond God (which brings up a whole different set of issues).

If God-B created logic, and he cannot be bound by that which he has created, then God-B is not bound by logic and thus is really just a form of God-A, which we know is silly.

Going beyond this, why is logically inconsistent to have beings that are <&quot;>pre-soul tempered<&quot;>, as in, they have all the qualities of personal growth upon being created. If you have the power to do *anything* why is making someone already fully developed not as feasible as making someone go through evil? It seems like a cop out to me.",ZippityZoppity,CC,4,,2

No two relationships are exactly the same, which is why I don't fear the other relationships my partners have; no matter what they have with that other person, it won't be what they have with me.  I couldn't replace someone I love with someone else because no matter who that other person is it could never be *them*.  In fact, my partners' freedom to seek out others is reassuring, rather than worrying.  Why?  If there's something they need, something that I can't give them, they have the opportunity to seek that out elsewhere rather than staying and resenting me or leaving in the hopes of finding someone who can.

I have talked about this with her and we have <&quot;>debated<&quot;> our views quite extensively, this is what made me worried.

I hope you are prepared to talk a bit more about this, because I still have some questions and you seem to be able to explain it properly.

&gt;I couldn't replace someone I love with someone else because no matter who that other person is it could never be them.

I have a hard time getting my head around this point of view. If I fall in love with someone it dominates my thoughts and feelings. If I feel down, I want a hug from her to comfort me. If I feel happy or proud I want to share it with her. If I see something romantic or have a great idea for a date or a gift I know it is for her. If she loves multiple partners, they can never all be loved <&quot;>as much<&quot;> (I'm sorry for this terrible wording) can they? You can't just go on the same great date idea you had with all of them one by one.

1fimyc,caap3ls,caan9fm,"Hi. May I ask something in relation to polyamory that I have been wondering about?

Let me paraphrase from [chapter 6](http://www.happinesshypothesis.com/happiness-hypothesis-ch6.pdf) of [The Happiness Hypothesis](http://www.happinesshypothesis.com/):

&gt; [p. 124] you have to understand the difference between two kinds of love: passionate and companionate. [...] passionate love is a Çƒˆ?—??wildly emotional state in which tender and sexual feelings, elation and pain, anxiety and relief, altruism and jealousy coexist in a confusion of feelings.Çƒˆ?—?? Passionate love is the love you fall into. It is what happens when CupidÇƒˆ?—?•s golden arrow hits your heart
&gt;
&gt; [p. 125] Berscheid and Walster define companionate love, in contrast, as Çƒˆ?—??the affection we feel for those with whom our lives are deeply intertwined.Çƒˆ?—?? Companionate love grows slowly over the years as lovers apply their attachment and caregiving systems to each other, and as they begin to rely upon, care for, and trust each other.
&gt;
&gt; Passionate love is a drug. [...] No drug can keep you continuously high. The brain reacts to a chronic surplus of dopamine, develops neurochemical reactions that oppose it, and restores its own equilibrium. [...] So if passionate love is a drugÇƒˆ?—?∆literally a drugÇƒˆ?—?∆it has to wear off eventually.

There is a graph from which we learn that passionate love only lasts a few monts. Many relationships seem to start with passionate love and then there is a breakup or companionate love takes over.

Now to my question:
I've always assumed that passionate love or <&quot;>having a crush<&quot;> or limerence are focused on one person. That, even in polyamorous relationships, there is always a maximum of only one person that you fall in love with, even if you have longer lasting relationships with others. That polyamory basically has to mean <&quot;>many companionate-love relationships and one or zero passionate-love relationship<&quot;>. According to what you know, can this be right?",Bobertus,CC,5,,2

1fimyc,caapfve,caanr4a,"Always worth trying to explain things.  The problem with something like this is that it's very <&quot;>feely<&quot;>, which makes it difficult to put into words.  There's a translation barrier, so to speak.  I'm glad you two are talking about it, because that at least means that dialogue is open and she understands that this is an issue for you.

I'm going to say straight out that part of the problem is your lack of experience.  Some of this involves understanding that's normally developed through trial and error, relationships and breakups, loving and losing.  This makes it tricky for me to convey in ways that you'll understand.

Working through your next paragraph, it's hard to explain the first part.  Different feelings, different people.  While I *don't* want you to misperceive the analogy (I don't view people as tools), it's like the saying, <&quot;>when all you have is a hammer.<&quot;>  For me, if the problem is that something has completely fallen apart and it *has* to be fixed by tomorrow or three months of planning goes to shit, talking to someone whose response will be to try to get me to relax, tell me it's not all that bad, and generally focus on how I'm feeling will just guarantee I fail.  Going to someone whose reaction is <&quot;>okay, here's how we can go about fixing this<&quot;> will actually help.  Vice versa, if I'm just generally feeling terrible talking to someone whose first instinct is to try to *fix* it is just going to make me feel even worse.  Because each partner has a different feel, is a different person, has different views and talents and reactions I *know* who to talk to about something.

You talk about <&quot;>dates<&quot;> and <&quot;>gifts<&quot;> as if they're one-size-fits-all.  What is the <&quot;>perfect gift<&quot;> or <&quot;>perfect date<&quot;> for one partner might be awful for another.  If you'd had more past relationships you'd probably be able to see this between them.  I'll try to just give a couple examples.  The <&quot;>perfect date<&quot;> for one partner might be going out, doing something crazy, surprising them.  That same date might completely freak out someone who's more introverted, somewhat anxious and prefers stable advance plans....their <&quot;>perfect date<&quot;> would look entirely different.  The reason it's easy for you to say <&quot;>perfect<&quot;> is because you've only got one model.  In your past relationship, when thinking about dates or gifts you automatically discarded things you knew wouldn't fit your partner.  Even so, many of those things you discarded as <&quot;>not perfect<&quot;> probably were, just not for her.  Because every partner is different, anything that's <&quot;>perfect<&quot;> is only going to be perfect for one: *that's* who it's for.  Trust me, this is probably as tricky for you to understand as it is completely self-explanatory to me.  This is why <&quot;>feely<&quot;> things are hard to work with.

Regarding the rest of one's life, I was mostly trying to emphasize the fact that many poly people *do* commit the same way mono people do.  We all know the one elderly couple that married in their teens and still act like it sometimes, it does happen on occasion.  I don't really need to say anything about the necessity of relationships, so I'll leave that be.

When I think of poly in the long term I think of it much like one would expect in a more standard relationship.  The only difference is a couple extra bedrooms.  The logistics are a discussion of their own, but in all honesty living with someone in the past has taught me that there's great value in being able to create some time alone when you need it.  At the same time, you talk about it as though you'd be sitting at home, alone, while she's off with other people.  You unconsciously limit yourself, because you don't think of the fact that it works both ways.  In any egalitarian poly relationship (the only kind I'd personally advocate) everyone plays by the same rules.  You talk about lying nights in bed knowing she's with another, but you don't think about the possibility of not being alone yourself.

For the most part, no, I'm not jealous.  Jealousy is one of the most complicated parts of poly, and there's a vast wealth of explanation out there that's far more detailed than anything I can provide here.  Some aspects are dealt with internally (addressing insecurities, identifying exactly what's causing the jealousy and why, separating it from envy, etc) and others are dealt with externally (being aware of your partners' feelings and working to avoid causing jealousy and similar).  There's no one simple solution or answer, but it's a surmountable problem in the same way fidelity is for monogamous relationships.

I would tend to describe poly in terms of an orientation, much like sexuality.  Some people are naturally monogamous, and simply can't function with multiple partners.  Others, like myself, are naturally polyamorous and can't imagine not being able to care about more than one person.  Finally, many (I don't really know how many, given that culture clearly plays a role and most ruthlessly hammer monogamy into people's heads from the time they can talk) people can work with both, depending on the people and the time.  It's fully possible that this is something you simply can't intuitively understand, just like how even someone heterosexual who isn't at all homophobic generally still can't quite get the idea of being attracted to someone of the same sex.  On the other hand, maybe not.

It's very difficult for me to describe the difference between love and friendship.  There definitely is one, and it's for me pretty unambiguous in most cases.  It's *not* simply <&quot;>close friendship plus sex<&quot;>.  I know, because I've had sex with friends despite a complete lack of what I'd call <&quot;>love<&quot;>.  Similarly, I've loved at least one person who I didn't have (at that point) sexual desire for.  Again, it's not something that's easy (or perhaps even possible) to describe (let's be honest, if it were a whole lot of songwriters would be out of work), but it's easy to identify.  For you, there's a clear distinction.  You focus very much on the monogamy aspect, the displacement of all others.  However, I'm sure you can pick out something more than that which distinguishes friendship from love.  Forget the monogamy aspect for a moment, pick out *those* differences, and that's probably it.",carasci,CC,4,Attacking the logic,2

It's fully possible that this is something you simply can't intuitively understand, just like how even someone heterosexual who isn't at all homophobic generally still can't quite get the idea of being attracted to someone of the same sex.  On the other hand, maybe not.

It's very difficult for me to describe the difference between love and friendship.  There definitely is one, and it's for me pretty unambiguous in most cases.  It's *not* simply <&quot;>close friendship plus sex<&quot;>.  I know, because I've had sex with friends despite a complete lack of what I'd call <&quot;>love<&quot;>.  Similarly, I've loved at least one person who I didn't have (at that point) sexual desire for.  Again, it's not something that's easy (or perhaps even possible) to describe (let's be honest, if it were a whole lot of songwriters would be out of work), but it's easy to identify.  For you, there's a clear distinction.  You focus very much on the monogamy aspect, the displacement of all others.  However, I'm sure you can pick out something more than that which distinguishes friendship from love.  Forget the monogamy aspect for a moment, pick out *those* differences, and that's probably it.",carasci,CC,3,Inadequate justification,7

Thank you so much for this thorough explanation. 

&gt; At the same time, you talk about it as though you'd be sitting at home, alone, while she's off with other people. You unconsciously limit yourself, because you don't think of the fact that it works both ways.

I did conemplate this quite a bit but so far I really can not imagine loving two partners at the same time. I can't imagine loving two people <&quot;>as much<&quot;> and I would feel terribly guilty for this distinction. Bad comparison but to try and show my point: If I order an ice cream and the vender has banana I'll always buy banana. If there is no banana available I'll settle for something else. But as long as banana wants to spend time with me I wouldn't choose to hang out with say vanilla. Wouldn't that be injust for vanilla? You could say it is something that can be arranged to spend time with both, but then while eating vanilla I'd always think, damn, I could have chosen banana today, why am I eating vanilla. God I messed this analogy up didn't I?

Anyway, I honestly feel that it would be unethical for me te be polyamorous.

But I do now understand that does not neccesarily goes the same for others. If I understand correctly you love multiple partners differently, so that how much you love them isn't actually comparable. This is a point of view I still hope to work towards.",pieterdc1,RE,3,,2

&gt; I believe love is an illusion/delusion where you believe that your partner is the only and perfect one for you and you plan to spend the rest of your life with.

That's because you see love as kind of a possession, or you have an overly romantic view on relationships.

See it like this: You have this very best friend. It doesn't exclude you from having other friends. If your lucky you have two best friends. Love is, as is friendship, a chemical reaction that gives us a strong feeling.

Now, about the cheating part. Every relationship at one point goes through ups and downs. Cheating happens when a person doesn't think their relationship is worth what they promised their partner. Cheating can happen in monogamous and polygamous relationships, it's lying. Some people lie, and some don't.

You (both) have to make up what kind of relationship you want, and you have to make clear to your partner that breaking the <&quot;>rules<&quot;> is breaking your trust and thus your relationship. The fact they talk openly about what they feel, is probably because they're open about it.
I know, it's not pleasant to know your love is having their go with someone else, and I say that as someone who believes it's natural, opposed to monogamy. I made the agreement with my love to have an <&quot;>don't ask, don't tell<&quot;> thing, not hiding it, but don't trust it in my face.

The same goes for your need for comfort or your need for action to get things done. People are not as one sided as you make them sound and one partner can act differently in the both situations you brought up.

I really can't get my head around the fact that you can have two partners, neither of them fulfilling all of your needs in stead of looking for one that can. To me this feels like buying a bycicly because you can bike past slow traffic but complaining it takes effort to bike so you also buy a car so you can be lazy but then you get stuck in traffic. In stead of just buying a motorcycle which gets you through slow traffic in a lazy way. It's a bad analogy but it's the best I could come up with. 

I do not mean to offend you but I feel that you are too 'pessimist' in thinking that you wont find one partner who can fit all your needs.

As much as I would like to, I am convinced I can not make this work. But thank you so much for helping me contemplate this and make up my mind about it. 

Maybe I'm not ready yet. Not experienced enough, like you said. Maybe Inll never be. Possibly I don't even want to ever be ready and give up my delusion of perfect love. There is no right defenition, just what you make of it, and I'll stick to mine for now.",pieterdc1,RE,3,,2

1fimyc,cab8gx0,cab7w0o,"Oh, sure.  There are lots of things that would be appreciated by more than one partner.  However, it's pretty rare that there isn't clearly one who it would be better for than another.  In my case, I tend towards partners who are very different in both interests and aptitudes, so there isn't that much overlap.  I expect it's more of a problem for people whose partners are more similar.

In some dynamics, it's also possible for things like that to be shared entirely.

It's always a matter of degree.  When explaining, it's easiest to opt for the most extreme examples, but in real life it's much more nuanced and takes a lot of work.  The way I've always put it is that relationship complexity is exponential.  Each additional relationship doubles the complexity rather than just increasing it.  It's easy to accidentally end up portraying it a utopian when trying to explain it, but in reality there's an awful lot of hard work involved.

To present a different example: poly is like having a bike for local transit when the weather is good, a car for when you have to go further than you can bike and when it's raining or snowy, and a pickup truck for your job where you need to carry bricks, lumber and tools.  All of them have different advantages (bicycle has limited range, takes effort, can't be used in snow, the car costs money in gas and can't carry large things, but can go further and in all weather, and the truck can do most of the things the car can but is murder on the wallet to drive) and there's a time and place for each.

I can't speak for all poly people.  However, in my case after several monogamous relationships failed miserably what I realized was not that my needs in a partner are simply complex, they're mutually contradictory.  It's not the easiest to explain, but it's less pessimism than realism.

Maybe you're not ready, maybe you're just not cut out for it.  Poly isn't utopian, it's just a relationship style that works for some people and not others.  Either way, at least now you know for certain without having to learn the hard way.",carasci,CC,2,,2

[Multiverse theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse) as well as the above monologues, to me, points more toward a universe that *embodies* God, rather than one that was *created by a* God.

The conception of an external God is a superfluous step. Any reasoning that could be applied to an external God to explain why such an entity would not need its own creator can be equally applied to the universe itself. Infinity does not need to have been created -- it can simply be. We are inside the workings of Nature As God following the rules it gave itself when 'whatever singularity that marks the origin of as far back as we can see' fragmented into the patterns that allow us to be what we are, as we speak.

What I have laid out is a philosophy that takes into account progressive findings in science. This is a subjective internal-logic that may or may not be flawed to a different subjectivity's internal logic. But *religion,* to me, needs nothing to do with it, and represents the antithesis to what philosophy is really about -- gnostic dogma as opposed to honest speculation and tentative conclusions from tentative premises. 

As a guiding principle in philosophy, I often take with me [Occam's razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor), a very powerful tool for thinking, and one that is designed to run counter to what religion is trying to achieve (via assumptions.) This is essentially what I was using, consciously or not, to determine that an external God seems like a superfluous step and requires more assumptions about the sensory world than the alternative that creation is not actually needed, and our creation represents a transformation of an infinitude of energy that was already there, and always has been, in constant movement, determined by its last total state, but both infinitely regressive *and* progressive -- twisting patterns into itself in as many ways as it is capable across cosmological timescales that may as well be infinite.",thepwnguin,CC,6,Providing contradicting knowledge,10

This is essentially what I was using, consciously or not, to determine that an external God seems like a superfluous step and requires more assumptions about the sensory world than the alternative that creation is not actually needed, and our creation represents a transformation of an infinitude of energy that was already there, and always has been, in constant movement, determined by its last total state, but both infinitely regressive *and* progressive -- twisting patterns into itself in as many ways as it is capable across cosmological timescales that may as well be infinite.",thepwnguin,CC,5,[GIVE A REASON],17
1fjr33,caaypz9,1fjr33,"Here's my take on all this.

Science doesn't prove an omniscient deity. From your responses, you appear to favor an <&quot;>intelligent design<&quot;> argument, that the apparent beauty and order of the Earth are proof that it must have been designed. However, just because you see order and beauty in things doesn't mean that they were intelligently designed, it just means that it was *extremely unlikely* that they were created by chance.

Let's look at probability for a moment, shall we? I'm sure you've heard about the old speculation that if you leave 100/1,000/however many monkeys you want in a room with typewriters for a long time, one of them will eventually reproduce the works of Shakespeare. There are a lot of different versions of this idea; you might also be familiar with the idea that <&quot;>if you assigned each letter to a different two-digit number, somewhere within pi is this post.<&quot;> The main idea here is that, given enough time, any configuration of things in a closed system CAN happen.

One argument against intelligent design explains that because the universe is so large (it's not infinite, but it's expanding pretty quickly), eventually, if you gave it enough time, Earth would HAVE to appear. In fact, if the universe were a closed system that never changed (which it isn't, but for the sake of conversation, it's not a terrible assumption), any variation of Earth might also appear. Now, the universe is at least 13 billion years old, so I'd say that it has had enough time for Earth to be plausible, from a random perspective.

Ultimately, you just have to think about the probability. What chance of Earth randomly appearing is too small for you to believe? 1 in 100? 1 in 10000000000000? 1 in 10^123141? Why is it unbelievable that Earth wasn't planned? If it's clear that it's at least *possible,* no matter how small the chance, then it doesn't have to have been intelligently designed.

On a side note, this doesn't prove that Earth **wasn't** intelligently designed, it just shows that it didn't have to be. I'm also a firm believer that while science doesn't PROVE God's existence, it doesn't DISPROVE it either.",TheMadHaberdasher,CC,5,,10

Take the evolution of a microorganisms for example. When you put a type of bacteria in a petri dish mimicking its ideal environment, you find the bacteria will survive and reproduce. You can grab samples of the bacteria and look at its genome. Now if you add an antibiotic to the dish, much of the bacteria will die. Some, however will be resistant to this antibiotic and will persist. You can now grab samples and look at it's genome. Comparing this genome with the ones grabbed previously will show you where the resistance lies genetically. You can now culture this bacteria on a plate similar to the one in step one. A whole new population of bacteria will develop and when looking at their genome, you will find they will have the antibiotic resistance.

This is a really good example of evolution, it's not just chance that resulted in the bacteria evolving. Environmental pressure plays a huge role. It would be more like if every time the monkey put words in the correct order they locked into place.

1g3j3i,cah2yuy,cah04ls,"&gt; If I can be swayed against an entire movement by simple dislike of an unpleasant extremist, then it's safe to say I'm either a complete moron or I already formed a pretty sturdy opinion of the movement.

As I said before, Glenn Beck doesn't make Republicans become Democrats or vice versa.  He serves to rile up the die hard base and further solidify an already Republican contingent.  He likely also serves as straw Republican for liberals.  He's not going to drastically change anyone's views, but to claim he has no impact at all is also false.

For example, there are a lot of indifferent atheists out there, including myself.  I don't really respect religion but I don't make an issue of it in general.  But when exposed to religious bigots like the Ralph Reed or WBC, it actually makes me think, perhaps I should be more active about it, at least as far as legislative efforts go.

Hamilton was against the Articles of Confederation, yes, as most people were. The AOC did not allow for enough power in the national government, which left them helpless; for example, the States were allowed to tax the people, not the national government, and were not legally bound to share that tax money with the national government. That sort of sucked, because they were, you know, trying to fund the Revolutionary War and the States weren't giving up any cash to do so. 

The original plan was to REVISE the Articles, and this was what the Anti-Federalists (those who argued against the Constitution, people like Patrick Henry, for example) wanted. However, The Federalists (James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, those types) basically decided to scrap the Articles altogether and draft a new constitution - this is the Constitution we ratified and still use today. 

They basically decided that there wasn't enough power in the national government, and that the States needed to be kept in check.

1g98dv,cai3ufj,cai3jlx,"Understandable. I don't mind explaining :) History is very interesting if you're willing to invest time into learning, however that may be (asking questions or reading books, whichever). 

Hamilton was against the Articles of Confederation, yes, as most people were. The AOC did not allow for enough power in the national government, which left them helpless; for example, the States were allowed to tax the people, not the national government, and were not legally bound to share that tax money with the national government. That sort of sucked, because they were, you know, trying to fund the Revolutionary War and the States weren't giving up any cash to do so. 

The original plan was to REVISE the Articles, and this was what the Anti-Federalists (those who argued against the Constitution, people like Patrick Henry, for example) wanted. However, The Federalists (James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, those types) basically decided to scrap the Articles altogether and draft a new constitution - this is the Constitution we ratified and still use today. 

They basically decided that there wasn't enough power in the national government, and that the States needed to be kept in check.

First, some perspective: At the time the Founding Fathers existed, there weren't too many democracies as we see it today.  There was a lot of royalty and some proto-parliamentary governments, but mainly, there wasn't any government dedicated to the principles of liberty and self-determination.  You had nations with nobility and class/caste systems that were socially rigid and quite oppressive.  

The Founding Fathers led and fought a Revolution against their colonial masters with the goal of creating the world's first liberal democracy.  A nation with no royalty or titles, or class system.  A nation where all men are equal, and the government that works for the people, not one which dictates to the people.

This vision is embodied in the United States Constitution.  A document which accomplishes two very simple things:

1.  Outlines what the government *can* do
2.  Outlines what the government *can't* do (technically the Bill of Rights)

So why do we reference them often?  Because there are many in the United States who wish to retain the ideals and principles upon which this nation was founded (by said Founding Fathers), which means a focus on respecting individual rights, private property, and minimal government interference into our lives.

**Why are the opinions of the Founding Fathers invaluable?** Because when it comes to issues of the US Constitution, their words and thoughts on the topic reveal the true intentions of that document and its associated Amendments.

When Americans talk about the 2nd Amendment, they point out that it protects all their rights to keep and bear any arms they want.  Why?  [Because the Founders intended it, and mentioned it several times.](http://cap-n-ball.com/fathers.htm)  They had a good reason for it too: not to foment revolt, but to reduce the monopoly on violence which a government can hold.  

Think about that for a minute: If the US Government had all the guns, then what can the people do against it if it went bad?  We'd be helpless.

Now, we understand it's 2013, and arguments like:

* <&quot;>if the 2nd Amendment means the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, it must mean nukes are free to own!<&quot;> 

Or:

* <&quot;>They didn't have 30 round magazine assault rifles in their time!<&quot;>

...are used, it doesn't mean the Founding Father were fallible.  For one thing, they were intelligent men, and knew technology would advance.  Which is why the 2nd Amendment protects modern weapons as much as the 1st Amendment protects computers.

They also knew if things had to change, that there needed to be a process by which to do so, which is why we can use [Article V of the US Constitution to do so.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution)

This point is pure anecdote, and it has no relevance to the actual debate.

See, that sort of point, at least from what I've seen, is what the entire argument from the anti-vaccination camp hinges on. My child got vaccinated, and two months later he came down with symptoms for autism. Ipso facto, it was from the vaccine. The symptoms of autism develop just about around when kids get many of their vaccines. It's not causation, it's not even correlation, it's anecdote, and there's never been any study ever correlating vaccines and autism rates, or any other major negative side effect with any significant prevalence.

&gt;Of course they're going to push unnecessary vaccinations on the public if it's profitable

Non sequitur. Yes, vaccines are profitable. That has no relevance to their effectiveness - Bill Gates is rich, that doesn't mean that Windows is a bad OS. Nor does that fact that Jobs was rich mean that Apple was.

&gt;So we immunize our children against diseases that they will more than likely never come into contact with

Unlikely? Yes. However, each extra person that gets vaccinated decreases that likeliness not only for that person, but for everyone else in the community. Do you want to know why we don't see instances of polio any more? It's because enough people got vaccinated that polio was wiped out in the US population. Now let's envision a scenario where we stop vaccinating our kids. Someone comes back from Africa or another developing country with the disease, and spreads it around. Suddenly - polio epidemic. There's still no cure for polio - people die. It's not that the diseases are 100% wiped out off the face of the Earth - they're just less common, but when people stop vaccinating, they have a chance to come back.

&gt;I know a main argument against vaccination is that the chances of getting infected or contracting the disease from the vaccine is a bigger risk than the actual disease itself. Maybe this points to the fact that we need better vaccinations, which is something that most people ignore blindly, except for the anti-vaccination crowd

That's not an argument at all. There's **never** been any study - **never** - that showed a significant risk or correlation between vaccines and any significant disease - a mild chance of an allergic reaction, and exceedingly, extremely rare worse side effects that are far more than cancelled out by the benefits. When the anti vaccine crowd complained about Thimerasol, a mercury additive to vaccines, it was removed, **even though there was no evidence that it was harmful**. There's still no evidence that it's harmful.

People are <&quot;>ignoring<&quot;> the fact that we need better vaccines because it's not a fact, and it never has been. There's never been any evidence that vaccines are significantly harmful, and therefore there's nothing to ignore other than the anecdotal evidence of some concerned parents. I'm not trying to minimize the parent's and child's suffering or emotions here - those are very real. However, there's no evidence that vaccines caused any of that.

&gt;In any case, if you are so sure that vaccines work, why are you worried?

They do work, but they're not perfect, and no one has ever claimed that they are. Even with a vaccine, it's possible - not nearly as likely, but possible, that you can get the disease. And every person that doesn't get the vaccine, the herd immunity decreases, and everyone is further at risk. Honestly, if what you're describing is actually happening, I think it's silly. Isolating unvaccinated children is silly. But that's a reflection on paranoid parents, not the effectiveness of the vaccine itself.

**TL;DR**: Sorry for the long post, but here's the gist: There's no valid evidence that vaccines are dangerous other than anecdotal evidence, and the benefits of vaccines are large enough that the anti-vaccine crowd has nothing to fall back upon.",AramilTheElf,CC,6,Provided contradicting knowledge and attacked the logic of each paragraph by the OP,12
1gqgon,camr7w4,1gqgon,"&gt;My little brother wasn't vaccinated, and he's one of the healthiest kids I've ever seen

This point is pure anecdote, and it has no relevance to the actual debate.

See, that sort of point, at least from what I've seen, is what the entire argument from the anti-vaccination camp hinges on. My child got vaccinated, and two months later he came down with symptoms for autism. Ipso facto, it was from the vaccine. The symptoms of autism develop just about around when kids get many of their vaccines. It's not causation, it's not even correlation, it's anecdote, and there's never been any study ever correlating vaccines and autism rates, or any other major negative side effect with any significant prevalence.

&gt;Of course they're going to push unnecessary vaccinations on the public if it's profitable

Non sequitur. Yes, vaccines are profitable. That has no relevance to their effectiveness - Bill Gates is rich, that doesn't mean that Windows is a bad OS. Nor does that fact that Jobs was rich mean that Apple was.

&gt;So we immunize our children against diseases that they will more than likely never come into contact with

Unlikely? Yes. However, each extra person that gets vaccinated decreases that likeliness not only for that person, but for everyone else in the community. Do you want to know why we don't see instances of polio any more? It's because enough people got vaccinated that polio was wiped out in the US population. Now let's envision a scenario where we stop vaccinating our kids. Someone comes back from Africa or another developing country with the disease, and spreads it around. Suddenly - polio epidemic. There's still no cure for polio - people die. It's not that the diseases are 100% wiped out off the face of the Earth - they're just less common, but when people stop vaccinating, they have a chance to come back.

&gt;I know a main argument against vaccination is that the chances of getting infected or contracting the disease from the vaccine is a bigger risk than the actual disease itself. Maybe this points to the fact that we need better vaccinations, which is something that most people ignore blindly, except for the anti-vaccination crowd

Sure they could be *more* effective - pretty much anything can. However, as of now they **are** effective, and while it's not bad to research better ways to implement them, it's certainly no reason not to take the vaccine or be against the use of the vaccine.

&gt;I maintain that polio is a fairly useless vaccine, as there are less than a thousand cases per year in a world of 7 billion people

But why is it so rare? It's because people are still getting vaccinated. Unless the disease is completely wiped out, once people stop getting vaccinated, the disease will slowly make a resurgence. Once the disease is literally wiped off the face of the Earth, except in research labs or whatnot, then the vaccine will be useless, but until then, if the population stops getting the vaccine the disease will almost inevitably make a resurgence.

Sure, maybe 2% of kids aren't vaccinated because of this movement. That's not going to threaten herd immunity too much. But maybe next year it's only 5%, then 10%, then when we're sitting at 40% of kids being unvacinnated, we're going to have some serious disease outbreaks and a lot of people are going to suffer and die. 

That's exactly why people who are passionate about it are trying to snuff this shit out now. There is absolutely no scientific basis on the anti-vaccination movement.

Also, kudos for you for not mentioning autism. That would truly make you sound uninformed. For me personally, even if vaccinations were proven to be a cause of autism, I'd still get my kid vaccinated. Worth it 100%",bigDean636,CC,4,,14

Re the Norwegian comment--

In America, mediocre rich kids can be taught to do well on all the measures of success. They might not be above average, but their test scores will be. Studies have shown, that in America, a large advantage is associated with high SES. 

In Norway, a poor kid is just as likely to do well on tests as a rich kid. SES offers no advantage. That means they are <&quot;>selecting<&quot;> on some other criteria.  I called this criteria native intelligence, but we could also describe it as natural ability X to do well in the Norwegian system. I don't know what X is, don't know Norwegian culture well enough to guess. 

I would disagree about the significant limits on <&quot;>making<&quot;> people <&quot;>smart.<&quot;> I think we seriously underestimate kids. Time after time we see that bad and mediocre students can excel under a really gifted teacher. We could be teaching to a much higher level than we are, IMO. Granted, there are hard limits on how many great teachers we seemingly can produce. But since great teachers can get substantially better results from any sample of students, student characteristics are no more important than teacher characteristics in this equation, within the normal range of intelligence. 

Anecdotal, but I worked with a special ed teacher whose mildly  mentally retarded students were working (and testing) on grade level in science. Now, I would agree that there are some limits to how far you can go (profoundly MR is a different story, turning MR students into geniuses is a stretch, etc.), but I don't think we are anywhere near those limits in most places.

I think we both agree that the failings of the American system have nothing to do with celebrity culture. I would not assign the blame to race, though, either.

You're leaving something out here. There's a piece of the puzzle I think you're intentionally leaving out.

There's a difference between being nice, being polite, and kissing someone's ass.

I still don't have a really clear idea of what specific idea that you're trying to challenge (sounds kind of like <&quot;>cops don't help people<&quot;>) but maybe some examples will help. The underlying principle of them being that police most often help the general population at an individual's expense. They are enforcers. 

* If I'm on a run and a patient gets violent with me, I can call the PD and they assist me in subduing the patient. This helps the patient in the long run and the population by removing a threat.
* As someone who scrapes people up off the road, I deeply appreciate them (even loosely) enforcing speed limits.
* I've seen cops block traffic for peds to change their tires on the highway.
* Police provide the documentation to insure the right insurance provider pays for collisions.

1hkm86,cavnv6r,1hkm86,"I've been a truck driver for 20 years and last fall, for the first time I was an eyewitness to a fatal traffic accident. I was driving northbound on a 2-lane highway and was following another semi when a minivan traveling south crossed the center line and hit the semi head on. The driver of the minivan was killed instantly while miraculously no one else was seriously hurt. 

The first responders arrived in under 5 minutes and soon there were about 20 emergency and law enforcement personnel present. I (and a few other motorists) gave a statement to a state trooper and I was struck by how professional and compassionate he was. He looked to be in his 50's and had most likely been on the state patrol for quite some time, yet even he seemed slightly shaken by what had just happened. Which kind of surprised me, because I always just kind of assumed that after a while, someone who sees horrible things like that on a regular basis would get desensitized and hardened and maybe even jaded after a while, but I got none of that from that state trooper. 

I've always had a lot of respect for LEO's, but that experience made me see them in a new light. What really made an impression on me was how understanding and sympathetic the trooper was with me and the other eyewitnesses for having just experienced something so traumatic. I told him that was the worst thing I'd ever seen and he grimly replied that he hoped I'd never have to see anything like that again. 

OP, I hope you never have to experience anything like that but perhaps you can have a better understanding of what LEO's have to deal with on a regular basis and maybe you can appreciate what they do a little more.

You can't be this self-centered. I didn't think somebody in their mid-twenties, in the military, would say something like this. Let's all go to youtube and find videos of military personnel doing 'bad things'. Let's count how many innocent have been killed by poorly trained, poorly informed, or just stupid soldiers. You'll find that it's not difficult to locate plenty of examples of soldiers making bad decisions. 

By this reasoning, lets question whether the bad out-weighs the good and consider getting rid of our military. You're probably thinking that this is an obviously bad idea. But **I** have never had a positive interaction with the military. I hear of good things that they've done, and of bad things.

You have an extremely limited experience with Police, often when YOU are the suspect(even on a traffic stop), just like I have very little interaction with military personnel in their professional environment. If this bothers you so much, and judging by your submitted post history, which is FULL of 'bad cop' videos, it must be, you should do a ride along with a local department. Talk to the officer, watch him/her as they are handling all kinds of calls throughout the shift.

You have had maybe 1-2 hours of interaction with Police if you're limited to a few traffic stops. Most Police work 12.5 hour shifts 42.5 hours a week. You need more experience to see what is actually taking place.

You are making a tremendous amount of assumptions and drawing big conclusions from a VERY limited sample size. The Police interact with a large number of citizens per day, if they treated them all poorly as you suggest, you wouldn't have any support for your local department. Just do a little research, and go on a ride along. It will change your views much more effectively than a bunch of redditors.


And as a final note, the Police **should** be nice and friendly to citizens, but they don't **have** to be nice and friendly. They can be very candid and dry if they want to. Some people will argue and fight with a nice and friendly officer, while the authoritative officer gets all the respect. It varies by the personality of the citizen. You sound like you are argumentative and disagreeable. Don't expect some retail customer service attitude from a Police Officer, they will reflect your attitude back on you.

I like that you use my words directed towards the military. It made me think about it for a few minutes. You are also the second person to suggest a ride-along. I might just do this.

I must point out though, that the military's profession isn't meant to interact with the civilian population like the police are.

1lp8a5,cc1fjpt,1lp8a5,"Y'know, I used to think the way you think.  I agree that it's not immediately obvious why it needs to automatically be racist when white people dress up like black people for the purpose of playing a role.  

But then, I only knew about blackface from reading about it.  The thing that changed my view was seeing [a movie that portrayed actors wearing blackface](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034862/).  By which I mean, it was a movie *about actors*, and some of the time they wore blackface to do shows.  And holy fuck, that is some racist shit.  I think my favorite (by which I mean <&quot;>cringiest<&quot;>) scene went something like this:  

Female lead, in her dressing room preparing for the show:  <&quot;>It's such a shame that I'll be wearing blackface tonight.  I so wanted to be beautiful for the audience.<&quot;>

Yes, the racism is primarily because of how it was handled rather than anything inherent about white people portraying black characters, but now it rightly has racist associations for everyone who's been paying attention.  

Furthermore, as long as racism is a real thing in the world, I think it's pretty hard for the <&quot;>privileged<&quot;> group to do the whole <&quot;>dress up as the unprivileged group for the purpose of acting!<&quot;> thing *without* bringing racism into the mix.  There are a couple main reasons for this:

1.  This isn't a bank job--actors *do* get chosen for roles in part because of how they look.  Having people who look <&quot;>wrong<&quot;> for the part play the part anyway has the effect of disenfranchising black actors.  A white person wearing blackface doesn't really look as authentic as a legit black person, but if your default is to hire a white person for the job anyway, you're contributing to a systemic lack of job prospects for black people.  

2.  If you mostly don't bother getting real black people to play your black characters, you're going to just end up entrenching racial stereotypes that may or may not be accurate.  It becomes a circlejerk of cluelessness and white privilege, because you've excluded anyone with the experience to potentially have a dissenting opinion.

Weirdly enough, point 2 *also* only became obvious to me upon watching that movie I linked above.  The movie portrayed a bunch of (white) actors going around putting on shows, so when they showed one with a guy in blackface pretending to be a former slave, the racial stereotypes from the 1940's really popped out.  

So, let's say that now you come along wanting to use blackface in your movie because you couldn't find any black people for the part (though I imagine that you probably had *binders full of black people* to choose from).  You don't think it's racist because you don't think you're racist--it's just that the best person for the job happened to be white.  But guess what?  Nobody cares whether you think you're racist.  Blackface pretty much always ends up being bad for black people one way or another, and people are right to pick up on that.  

White people, as a group, have collectively lost their <&quot;>using blackface without social repercussions<&quot;> privileges, because we've shown that we can't be responsible with it.  In a future society in which racism is no longer a thing, I expect that we'll all be able to go back to using blackface whenever we feel like it, because it won't automatically look like stinging mockery of an already disenfranchised group.",spiffyzha,CC,6,"Personal experience of view change.

Yay!  Thank you.

On the topic of historical context though, I know it can be tempting to just ignore it all.  I definitely am prone to doing it too, and I've not ever really heard anyone make a compelling argument for *not* ignoring it.  So I'll attempt to generate such an argument myself, and I suppose you can tell me how well I've done.  

The thing about historical context is that it isn't always so far removed from the present.  I can think of two problems that this presents.  Firstly, since social customs are a constantly evolving thing, if it hasn't taken a very long time to get away from a problematic social custom or ideology, that also means that it won't take much to push us all back to those regressive ways.  It's better if we try to push the world in a 'positive' direction instead. 

In relation to blackface, this means that if you're more interested in arguing that it isn't racist (ie, defending the privilege of the privileged class to do X without social ridicule) than on trying to get away from racism, you're focusing on the wrong thing.     At its core, the problem is racism, not the social backlash to racism.  The backlash will fade too once the racism itself is gone.  (To be clear, I'm not saying that you personally are doing this.  I'm just saying it as a general rule of thumb for you/other people to think about.)

But also!  When the historical context isn't very far removed from the present, that means that it's still likely to be a sore spot for a lot of people.  There are lots of people still alive who remember a time when black people *literally* didn't have the same legal protections as white people.  It all seems so foreign for someone my age who grew up in a place without significant racial tensions, but it's not foreign at all to a lot of people who I probably interact with all the time.  To those people, blackface isn't just actors trying to do a good job of portraying their character;  it's about a culture that sees you as a walking stereotype--and a negative one, at that--with no distinguishing characteristics of your own.  And blackface is just one tool among many in their arsenal, but the people against whom it's directed will be very familiar with the variety of subtle racist things it allows to be introduced in an uncritical manner.

1ncxna,cchh690,1ncxna,"Okay, so you want to succeed at things. That's great! How do you propose going about doing that? If the things you want to succeed at are at all significant, then they're probably not trivially easy. That means they require skill. The only way to acquire skill is practice. Practice necessarily involves failure.

You have two options: either keep trying things and giving up immediately when you fail, in which case you will have a very shallow understanding of a wide variety of things and very little success, or pick something that you want to succeed at and start practicing it. Assuming you practice it intelligently (one crappy drawing a week with no prompt or reference does not count as practicing drawing) you will get better, and you will eventually succeed.

1ooyb1,ccu41n1,1ooyb1,"I want to say two things:

First, let me tell you a story about the first time I ever did shrooms.

I was raised in a really, really abusive household. My father raped me and beat me and locked me in closets and mentally battered me. My mom was an alcoholic. My sister hated me. I hated myself. When I did shrooms, all of that was different. It was the first time in my life I actually felt what 'being happy' was. It was completely new. Things were brighter, I could laugh, I *felt* things. It was also the first time that I thought I could actually have sex with someone and not feel ashamed. 

I don't advocate for drug use, but I don't think that temporary happiness is bad. I couldn't just 'fix it', because it was my life. I couldn't 'fix' my mother or 'fix' my father. I was too afraid to call the police, and my dad manipulated me into thinking that it was *normal* anyway. I thought everyone's life was like mine, and everyone wanted to kill themselves. But this gave me an experience to hold on to. Did I abuse the drugs in the future looking for this feeling? Yeah. Did it keep me alive? I like to think so. I honestly think that if I had never felt this ephemeral happiness, if I had honestly thought that life was just the misery I lived in, I would have killed myself.

Secondly, I'd like to talk about your view on unhappiness. Depression and anxiety are actual disorders. They are the result of a lot of things, but mainly there's a lack of certain chemicals in your brain. This is why SSRIs and other antidepressants and anti anxiety medication exists. With therapy, drugs, and other things, it's totally possible to recover from depression (just so you know: they say you're in remission from depression. Not cured). 

Therefore, you can't just tell someone to 'fix' their lives. People are complicated, and their reasons for doing things are complicated. A person in an abusive relationship (usually) can't just get up and leave, and often don't realize they're in it to begin with. A college student who's depressed because they don't have enough serotonin in their brain can't just 'fix it' and make it better. Sure, yes, you can exercise and you can eat certain things and you can try real hard and go to therapy and take 'accepted' drugs. But that takes a long time. And a lot of times, when you're depressed, it seems like it's never going to end. You can't remember before, and you can't see the end of it.

Drugs are like an immediate fix. An immediate relief from feeling downright awful. And I don't think that's that bad. I think that, in a lot of cases, a lot of major addictions can destroy lives and relationships. I think that some drugs are definitely more dangerous than others. I also think that some drugs are relatively safer than OTC drugs or drugs prescribed by your doc. 

The best thing I've ever heard about depression is from hyperbole and a half and is something like <&quot;>Trying to think your way out of depression is like a man with no hands trying to will them to grow back.<&quot;>",pebbles_for_petra,CC,4,Gives a wider perspective.,18

Drugs are like an immediate fix. An immediate relief from feeling downright awful. And I don't think that's that bad. I think that, in a lot of cases, a lot of major addictions can destroy lives and relationships. I think that some drugs are definitely more dangerous than others. I also think that some drugs are relatively safer than OTC drugs or drugs prescribed by your doc. 

The best thing I've ever heard about depression is from hyperbole and a half and is something like <&quot;>Trying to think your way out of depression is like a man with no hands trying to will them to grow back.<&quot;>",pebbles_for_petra,CC,6,Pointing out practical concerns,26
1ooyb1,ccu41n1,1ooyb1,"I want to say two things:

First, let me tell you a story about the first time I ever did shrooms.

I was raised in a really, really abusive household. My father raped me and beat me and locked me in closets and mentally battered me. My mom was an alcoholic. My sister hated me. I hated myself. When I did shrooms, all of that was different. It was the first time in my life I actually felt what 'being happy' was. It was completely new. Things were brighter, I could laugh, I *felt* things. It was also the first time that I thought I could actually have sex with someone and not feel ashamed. 

I don't advocate for drug use, but I don't think that temporary happiness is bad. I couldn't just 'fix it', because it was my life. I couldn't 'fix' my mother or 'fix' my father. I was too afraid to call the police, and my dad manipulated me into thinking that it was *normal* anyway. I thought everyone's life was like mine, and everyone wanted to kill themselves. But this gave me an experience to hold on to. Did I abuse the drugs in the future looking for this feeling? Yeah. Did it keep me alive? I like to think so. I honestly think that if I had never felt this ephemeral happiness, if I had honestly thought that life was just the misery I lived in, I would have killed myself.

Secondly, I'd like to talk about your view on unhappiness. Depression and anxiety are actual disorders. They are the result of a lot of things, but mainly there's a lack of certain chemicals in your brain. This is why SSRIs and other antidepressants and anti anxiety medication exists. With therapy, drugs, and other things, it's totally possible to recover from depression (just so you know: they say you're in remission from depression. Not cured). 

Therefore, you can't just tell someone to 'fix' their lives. People are complicated, and their reasons for doing things are complicated. A person in an abusive relationship (usually) can't just get up and leave, and often don't realize they're in it to begin with. A college student who's depressed because they don't have enough serotonin in their brain can't just 'fix it' and make it better. Sure, yes, you can exercise and you can eat certain things and you can try real hard and go to therapy and take 'accepted' drugs. But that takes a long time. And a lot of times, when you're depressed, it seems like it's never going to end. You can't remember before, and you can't see the end of it.

Drugs are like an immediate fix. An immediate relief from feeling downright awful. And I don't think that's that bad.

1ooyb1,ccu4bsi,1ooyb1,"I think your view is skewed because it is an incomplete view of what we call happiness. Essentially, the pleasure center of the brain is presented with chemical stimuli that either trigger the release of dopamine or not. So, we eat a cheeseburger, our taste buds confirm that in fact it's a cheeseburger (something fattening and good for our survival) and sends the chemical message to the brain giving it 'permission' to release dopamine. The dopamine makes us feel great and we say yum.  


So basically, all the things that make us happy (laughter, sex, food, family, seeing beautiful celebrities and fantasizing) are the pleasure center of the brain <&quot;>confirming<&quot;> the release of dopamine.Most drugs hijack this process, tricking the brain into thinking we did something good for our survival, in the same way that splenda or artificial sweeteners mimick the chemical makeup of sugar and trick our taste buds into sending the signal to the brain that we are eating something that is good for our survival.  

Given this framework for happiness, there are very few things that we can do to garner happiness without going to some outside source (mindful breathing, yoga and positive imagery being about the only things that release dopamine that don't require an outside source) Cheeseburgers, or TV shows, or alcohol, or anything outside of us are a transient happiness. Your argument, that drugs are wrong because they are fleeting, is really an argument for why we should all be monks, deriving our only pleasure from mindful meditation and only taking in the most basic food for fuel. 
 

I think the biggest piece your argument hinges on is two things, 1) that drugs don't actually do anything good for us to make us happy, and 2) the potential for addiction. 

To point 1) I believe that many things do this for us. TV shows, having sex not for the purpose of making babies, fake sweeteners, coffee, facebook likes and twitter followers, are all manufactured happiness that are designed to trick this very old evolved sense of 'happiness' into thinking we are doing something good for our survival, when we in fact are not.  So, it stands to reason, that *reasonable* use of drugs and alcohol to boost our happiness is actually just fine, because frankly, it's just as fake as anything else we do to make ourselves happy.  A second donut even though we don't really need it might make us happy for the indulgence of it. A beer or two with friends to enhance the mood seems reasonable. Medical marijuana to help a patient ease symptoms seems perfectly reasonable.

To point 2) the potential for addiction, I think this is the strongest part of your argument. This has to do with the question 'how reasonable is the use of the fake happiness?' And this is entirely debatable. So perhaps amending your view to be <&quot;>drugs are wrong if you are using them to ineffectively mask sadness or life problems, because they won't make the problem go away, and there's a bigger chance that you'll develop even bigger problems if you become dependent on an addictive substance.<&quot;>",bigmanbeats,CC,5,Presents the argument coherently,18

The Islanders and the Hurricanes have more games played, and fewer non-overtime losses.  So their standing is naturally higher, because they didn't get creamed as many times as the Blue Jackets.

&gt; NHL teams are rewarded for just getting to overtime, a concept that in my mind is utterly ridiculous. A win should be a win and a loss should be a loss.

Other sports did not historically have a draw outcome.  The overtime loss point is historically derived from that fact.  You might think, oh well an OT loss is just a loss.  No, its not.  Its an OT loss, that is why they call it an OT loss not a normal loss.

If you lose in regulation time, then your team is clearly not superior, but if you lose in overtime its a pretty safe bet that both teams are of comparable skill.  The system also allows for seeds based on comparable loss+OT loss rates, so if a team A loses 10 games, and team B loses 10 games in OT, its pretty clear that team B did better than team A that season.  Its a useful mechanic.

Remember there are only 30 teams in like 4 divisions.

Ties are more common in the NHL. 

Playing until a win is great in the playoffs but not something you want in the regular season.

Playing a full 4th period and then having a tie is still too much and doing 10 mins instead of the current 5 wouldn't change much.

Before the current system overtimes were dull because the risk was greater than the reward.

If your idea is put in then OT will revert to dull play and have more wins and loses decided by shoot out. You give no reward to teams who play even for 3 periods and make no distinction between a 3-2 loss in OT and a 7-0 blowout in regulation.

Denver Broncos are 12-4 at the end of the year.

Kansas City Chiefs are 12-3-1 at the end of the year.

Kansas City is going to get seeded one spot higher than Denver.  Do you think that this is wrong?  If so, I would be interested to know why.

The rationale, though, is that you should be rewarded more for a tie than a loss, but not as much as a win.  So you give essentially a <&quot;>half<&quot;> a point in the standings.  And this is exactly what's done in the NHL.

More often than not, in the NHL, shoot outs are essentially coin flips.  You have high-skill athletes making guesses at which way the other player's going to go.  If you win this coin flip, or if you win in the 5 minute overtime, you get a bonus - you get the credit for the win.  But for all intents and purposes, this game was a tie - even after full time.  You still want to reward a team for tying, because they've played well enough to earn more points than a regulation loss.

The NHL is different from the NFL only in degree, but not in principle.  There are fewer points scored in an NHL game than in an NFL game, so it's harder to avoid overtime (a 3-3 tie might equate to a 32-28 win).  But in principle, the effect is the same - **you want to give more points than a loss, but less points than a win, when you effectively tie another team**.

Now, I would argue, that a loss registered within the 5 minute OT period should maybe not count as a full point, since it is not as much of a toss-up as a shoot-out, or in other words, it's not as legitimate of a tie (because in the NFL, you don't get points for losing in the 15 minute OT period).

It works no better or worse than private healthcare and the only real difference that I could see was the lack of a private room and the waiting times.

Doctors and nurses are humans and I'm by no means convinced that the standard of medical care that I would have received from the doctors or the skills of the surgeon would have been any better in a private hospital and in fact, in many cases it's the same doctors who work for the state health system that also do private work!

1pt86v,cd5w5ah,1pt86v,"I suppose the benefit is universal availability. I mean, in the US, everyone can go to a hospital and get treated, but not everyone has insurance, and some people really can't afford it. So, I'd say that waiting for five or six hours (I'd say that's on the high side, when I broke my wrist I think I waited half an hour) is a really really fair trade off when you consider that it doesn't cost you anything outside of taxes. As I understand it, that bill could be thousands of dollars for the uninsured in the US. I've heard stories of people ending up with *hundreds* of thousands in debt in the US from things like car accidents and diseases. 

Let's talk about tax. All of the following is made with the assumption of no RRSP/401k (same thing basically) contributions, or any other deductions. Where I live, making a median wage as an individual (around $40k), I have an average rate of 16.5% or so. If I made 100k, I'd be paying average rate of like 26%.

Now, I don't know a lot about the US tax laws, but using online calculators, a few gave me the same results (+/- negligible amounts), and said that with $40k, my average tax rate is just under 15%, and for 100K my average tax rate is around 22.5%. So we've got 16%/26% vs 15%/22%. 

Assuming those rates are reasonably accurate, we're talking about a yearly difference of about $400 for the 40k, the average person. Now, I don't really know how much health insurance costs an individual in the US, but as far as I can tell from the first few hits on google, it's significantly more than $400/year. *Assuming you can get it*. Canadians are not excluded due to pre-existing conditions. So a tax-paying American WITH health insurance appears to be paying more for tax+HC than a Canadian pays for HC-inclusive tax (in that income range, although it would seem that for wealthier income ranges this would be reversed). Keep in mind that universal healthcare is meant mainly to benefit those who wouldn't be able to afford healthcare otherwise.

This is sort of the problem I have with the privatized system. The people most likely to not have health insurance are those who cannot afford it, and they are the ones who end up getting slapped with a potential life-time of debt for emergency hospital visits or long-term treatment. Is tens of thousands or more in debt for an individual who was hit by a car and can no longer work his/her low paying job that couldn't afford insurance the sort of thing that, societally, we think should be okay? I suppose it depends on your values. It seems to me that the privatized system is really balanced in favour of the wealthy, and systemically screws the poor. 

One key argument against it is that wealthy tax-payers are covering the bill for the poorer of us. This is true. Again, value judgement. People without kids still pay for education, people who never have a fire at their house are still paying for a fire department. Why should anyone have to pay for something they don't benefit from? Well, it's about positive externalities. Having education, emergency services, and health-care available to all makes a society a more prosperous place. I guess, based on my values, I'm willing to wait an annoying amount of time to get care for my non-life threatening healthcare services knowing that we all have access to it, and no one's going directly in to debt for health reasons.",RageLippy,CC,6,,29

Assuming those rates are reasonably accurate, we're talking about a yearly difference of about $400 for the 40k, the average person. Now, I don't really know how much health insurance costs an individual in the US, but as far as I can tell from the first few hits on google, it's significantly more than $400/year. *Assuming you can get it*. Canadians are not excluded due to pre-existing conditions. So a tax-paying American WITH health insurance appears to be paying more for tax+HC than a Canadian pays for HC-inclusive tax (in that income range, although it would seem that for wealthier income ranges this would be reversed). Keep in mind that universal healthcare is meant mainly to benefit those who wouldn't be able to afford healthcare otherwise.

This is sort of the problem I have with the privatized system. The people most likely to not have health insurance are those who cannot afford it, and they are the ones who end up getting slapped with a potential life-time of debt for emergency hospital visits or long-term treatment. Is tens of thousands or more in debt for an individual who was hit by a car and can no longer work his/her low paying job that couldn't afford insurance the sort of thing that, societally, we think should be okay? I suppose it depends on your values. It seems to me that the privatized system is really balanced in favour of the wealthy, and systemically screws the poor. 

One key argument against it is that wealthy tax-payers are covering the bill for the poorer of us. This is true. Again, value judgement. People without kids still pay for education, people who never have a fire at their house are still paying for a fire department. Why should anyone have to pay for something they don't benefit from? Well, it's about positive externalities. Having education, emergency services, and health-care available to all makes a society a more prosperous place. I guess, based on my values, I'm willing to wait an annoying amount of time to get care for my non-life threatening healthcare services knowing that we all have access to it, and no one's going directly in to debt for health reasons.",RageLippy,CC,4,,30
1pt86v,cd5w5ah,1pt86v,"I suppose the benefit is universal availability. I mean, in the US, everyone can go to a hospital and get treated, but not everyone has insurance, and some people really can't afford it. So, I'd say that waiting for five or six hours (I'd say that's on the high side, when I broke my wrist I think I waited half an hour) is a really really fair trade off when you consider that it doesn't cost you anything outside of taxes. As I understand it, that bill could be thousands of dollars for the uninsured in the US. I've heard stories of people ending up with *hundreds* of thousands in debt in the US from things like car accidents and diseases. 

Let's talk about tax. All of the following is made with the assumption of no RRSP/401k (same thing basically) contributions, or any other deductions. Where I live, making a median wage as an individual (around $40k), I have an average rate of 16.5% or so. If I made 100k, I'd be paying average rate of like 26%.

(I would be a jerk if I expected otherwise.)

For as long as I have been going to the gynecologist (about 20 years), the fastest I have gotten an appointment was when I had a pap smear come back questionable, and they had me back in the next week.

I could probably get a mammogram faster than that if I found something, but I'll have to book my first baseline mammogram and yearly scans several months in advance.

1qqv4x,cdfjbtk,1qqv4x,"Well, I was a history major, so I suppose I should chime in.  Also, I went to law school, so there's that.  My perspective will come primarily from there.

First, at least in America, we use our history to inform our legal analyses when particular rights come into question.  The extent to which this occurs depends on the particular judicial philosophy to which you describe, and the right in question.  Originalists, for example, are going to seriously scrutinize the arguable intent of the drafters of laws when discerning how they should be applied in today's context.  Even those who subscribe to a living constitution are going to look at least a bit at the historical origin and purpose of a law before articulating its application in a modern context.  We very rarely start out *tabula rasa.*

Similarly, plenty of our analyses *require* looking at history regardless of the emphasis each judge's philosophy requires.  Our 14th amendment's fundamental rights analysis requires us to look <&quot;>our Nation's history, legal traditions, and practices.<&quot;>  If you want to understand the law as it affects your personal rights, you're going to want to have some understanding of the rationale behind it, and there is a lot of play between that and our history.  This is especially true with our 14th amendment because it implicates a lot of our sexier issues, ranging from gay marriage and adoption to prohibitions on forced sterilization to abortion to physician assisted suicide to anything other issue you are probably bombarded with on a daily basis.

And it's not just American history.  America's legal code is primarily based in English common law that had been articulated informally by their courts for *centuries* before we ported it over here.

I suppose it really boils down to what kind of person or citizen you want to be.  Our nation was founded on the concept that the individual person is the best depository of our rights.  Part of being vigilant requires knowing the historical basis for our rights.  Another part means understanding the rationale behind our very government structure.  If you were to read The Federalist Papers, for example, you'd see references to both the successes and failures of Greek and Roman political structure as a justification for our own unique form of government.  The same can be said for the Anti-Federalist Papers, and even the letters passed between the drafters of our Constitution and other legal documents.  What's the role of government in A, B and C?  You'd have to start from its inception and work from there.

The short end of it is that not all history is just learning trivia about dates and numbers.  A huge chunk of it, especially in the upper echelons of academia, is making a tie between broader themes and the implications for us today, not just the old cliche of <&quot;>learning from our mistakes.<&quot;>  Part of being an informed citizen means being educated and acquiring the requisite critical thinking skills to scrutinize the facts put before us, and these can be honed by studying history.  Finally, in a political climate that constantly references our political history as a justification for anything and everything, it's important to be able to separate fact from bologna.

As an aside, you can come on here and talk about stuff.  That's what I do.  Having to articulate my thoughts in a coherent and meaningful way is certainly a useful skill that I learned partially from pursuing my history degree.

Do you value experience in life? Do you think a 15 y.o teenager can learn something from a 40 y.o person? (This is not about superiority, though. You can point out that the 40 y.o. can learn from the 15 y.o. and it still won't change the point.)

How would we know that power corrupts, if we don't look back?  
How would we know what human beings are capable of?  
How would we know ancient and time-tested strategy and tactics?

1qqv4x,cdfyg3l,cdfj5de,"Not a history major, but I have a lot of friends majoring in history at a small liberal arts school.  The most important thing they learn is related to research and evaluating sources.  One of the most important classes they take is dedicated to the theory of writing about history.  There's lots of -isms (realism, marxism, deconstructionism, structuralism, etc.) that are used to describe and analyze the way historians do their job.  The take-away from that class is that you get pretty good at understanding the motives and perspective of a writer.  When you read enough sources involving the same subject, you're able to strip away the biases of the author, synthesize the information, and come away with something that more closely resembles the <&quot;>truth<&quot;>.

This comes in handy particularly with professions related to law and journalism, as well as very handy life/professional skills like reading people.

Consider this: at my college, students take 4 classes a semester.  That means they will take a total of 32 classes during their time at college.  I'd guess about a 4th of those are used up for various prerequisites (at least).  Many of my history major friends take up minors or areas of interest outside of history (art, economy, biology, etc.), so in the end I'd estimate they take about 16 history classes.  Guess how much of history you can cover in 16 classes, and guess how deeply you cover it.  Not very.  I wouldn't be surprised if I knew more about the fall of Rome than most of my friends, but that's not really what they're there to learn about.

Translated into English, that means when you encounter a conspicuous do-gooder, you feel guilty somehow.  You suspect you're eating wrong, not exercising, destroying the environment, or whatever, and this person is about to judge you for it.  Or, maybe you don't feel you're doing anything wrong, but this person is still going to morally judge you.  So, you attack preemptively.  In essence, you're responding to an imaginary attack.  This is why people get hostile when they find out you're a vegan or drive a Prius.  It's also why nobody likes Helen Lovejoy.

     <&quot;>Participants rated vegetarians less positively after imagining [the vegetarians'] 
     moral judgment of meat eaters. These studies empirically document the backlash 
     reported by moral minorities and trace it back to resentment by the mainstream 
     against feeling morally judged.<&quot;>

That's what's going on here.

You suspect you're eating wrong, not exercising, destroying the environment, or whatever, and this person is about to judge you for it.  Or, maybe you don't feel you're doing anything wrong, but this person is still going to morally judge you.  So, you attack preemptively.  In essence, you're responding to an imaginary attack.  This is why people get hostile when they find out you're a vegan or drive a Prius.  It's also why nobody likes Helen Lovejoy.

     <&quot;>Participants rated vegetarians less positively after imagining [the vegetarians'] 
     moral judgment of meat eaters. These studies empirically document the backlash 
     reported by moral minorities and trace it back to resentment by the mainstream 
     against feeling morally judged.<&quot;>

That's what's going on here.

In the status quo, the vast majority of U.S. college freshmen arrive straight from high school. [However, an increasing number of students are electing to take a <&quot;>gap year,<&quot;>](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/your-money/an-often-costly-year-to-bridge-the-gap-between-high-school-and-college.html) which involves taking a year off from school prior to enrolling in college. 

A gap year can be spent doing any number of things. Individuals can join a national service program, gain work experience (saving money for college in the process), enroll in a vocational program, travel, volunteer, explore hobbies, or pursue any combination therein. While many students choose to apply to college as high school seniors and defer admission for one year, students may also delay applying until their gap year, which would be after they have already graduated from high school. 

There is a very obvious disadvantage to taking a gap yearÇƒÓin theory, students' earning potential is delayed by one year. But I think the benefits can make it worthwhile. Here are just a few reasons:

1. Countless studies show that high school grades are the best predictor of college performance, and the senior year of high school is typically the most rigorous for students. Yet most colleges typically make admissions decisions with incomplete data about applicants' senior year grades. Mandating a gap year would both incentivize high school seniors to work hard and not slack off as well as allow colleges to make more informed admissions decisions. 

2. Another admissions-related factor is that students would be able to use their gap year to strengthen their application. <&quot;>What are you doing during your gap year?<&quot;> could very well become a standard essay question on applications. This could particularly benefit students whose socioeconomic backgrounds inhibit them from participating in extracurricular activities in high school, putting them on level footing with their peers.

3. College preparationÇƒÓa gap year allows students to explore their interests in a manner that can prepare them for the college experience. First, students can gain a better idea of what major and what coursework appeals to them, avoiding the freshman year <&quot;>undeclared<&quot;> trap that often leaves students making inefficient coursework decisions. As such, delaying matriculation by one year would not necessarily delay college graduation by one year, particularly for freshmen who would otherwise be indecisive about their goals. [The literature also suggests](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01425690600996717#.UpUm9WRDsVk) that gap year students are more adaptable and demonstrate greater maturity than non-gap year students, making them less distracted by college life and reducing the likelihood of them dropping out.

4. Workforce preparationÇƒÓa gap year allows students to gain valuable skills and experience. [There is an empiric preference for gap year students among employers](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01425690600996717#.UpUm9WRDsVk):

1swelx,1swelx,1swelx,"I believe neoliberalism, as the dominant political economy regime of the last 35 years, is responsible for a great deal of the inequality and decreasing social mobility in the USA and the world today. CMV. **Meta: I just finished an upper-level economic geography class that I really enjoyed. It was taught by a prominently left-wing professor, but I felt most of the arguments were pretty reasonable and in line with the rest of what I have been taught. I am open to other opinions though and want to see if anyone can propose credible counter-narratives.**

**Naturally it is very hard to summarize an argument that hundreds of books and articles have been written on but I will do my best.**


Neoliberalism as I am defining it here refers to the dominant ideology that came effect after the collapse of Fordism in the late 1970s. Fordism was defined by mass domestic production coupled with mass domestic consumption and a fairly robust welfare state. It reached a crisis in the late 1970s with the convergence of foreign competition, oil crises, and increasingly militant labor unions. Neoliberalism, developed by thinkers such as Milton Freidmann and Friedrich Hayek at the Chicago School of Economics, supported free-market economics, strict inflation control, reduced spending on welfare and other social programs, and deregulation of labor and financial markets.

Neoliberalism became the dominant ideology in the US through the election of Reagan (and in the UK with Thatcher) and his administration who attempted to realize the neoliberal vision during his presidency via deregulation and cuts to social welfare programs. During this time neoliberalism also spread to various international agencies such as the World Bank, IMF and WTO. This period of deregulation is usually called the <&quot;>roll-back<&quot;> period of neoliberalism. Economies grew rapidly, but the cycles of boom and bust in capitalism grew faster as a result. Also, economic inequality became decoupled from economic growth - economic growth no longer was a rising tide for all boats, only a few due to deregulation.

In the 1990s, the dominant notions of neoliberalism continued to hold sway even under more politically liberal presidents like Clinton, who did not actively try to counter neoliberalism but rather just soften some of its more damaging effects via new ways of administering welfare. Neoliberalism continues to be the dominant ideology of both political parties today.

The effects of neoliberalism are varied and wide-ranging, but I will try to list a few here:

* Much of the development of the third world has been halted  or even reversed via Structual Adjustment Programs administered by the IMF etc. Third world countries who fell behind on their debts had to agree to the IMF's neoliberal changes (essentially replacing state-led development with market-led development) that have not worked out at all.

Neoliberalism as I am defining it here refers to the dominant ideology that came effect after the collapse of Fordism in the late 1970s. Fordism was defined by mass domestic production coupled with mass domestic consumption and a fairly robust welfare state. It reached a crisis in the late 1970s with the convergence of foreign competition, oil crises, and increasingly militant labor unions. Neoliberalism, developed by thinkers such as Milton Freidmann and Friedrich Hayek at the Chicago School of Economics, supported free-market economics, strict inflation control, reduced spending on welfare and other social programs, and deregulation of labor and financial markets.

Neoliberalism became the dominant ideology in the US through the election of Reagan (and in the UK with Thatcher) and his administration who attempted to realize the neoliberal vision during his presidency via deregulation and cuts to social welfare programs. During this time neoliberalism also spread to various international agencies such as the World Bank, IMF and WTO. This period of deregulation is usually called the <&quot;>roll-back<&quot;> period of neoliberalism. Economies grew rapidly, but the cycles of boom and bust in capitalism grew faster as a result. Also, economic inequality became decoupled from economic growth - economic growth no longer was a rising tide for all boats, only a few due to deregulation.

In the 1990s, the dominant notions of neoliberalism continued to hold sway even under more politically liberal presidents like Clinton, who did not actively try to counter neoliberalism but rather just soften some of its more damaging effects via new ways of administering welfare. Neoliberalism continues to be the dominant ideology of both political parties today.

The effects of neoliberalism are varied and wide-ranging, but I will try to list a few here:

* Much of the development of the third world has been halted  or even reversed via Structual Adjustment Programs administered by the IMF etc. Third world countries who fell behind on their debts had to agree to the IMF's neoliberal changes (essentially replacing state-led development with market-led development) that have not worked out at all.
* Domestically, neoliberal deregulation has expanded the role of the finance sector and complicated debt-financing instruments and has created a more unstable economy. This led to the 2008 financial crisis.
* Cities are becoming increasingly less democratic as they are forced to compete for businesses/development to expand their reduced revenues. Companies basically now dictate what cities have to offer in order to get the jobs the company is offering to locate in their cities.

1swelx,ce1wac2,1swelx,"If Freidman and Hayek really had all that power then why are a majority of economists and politicians Neokeynesian?

Deregulation is one of those things that has both positives and negatives to it. When a deregulation is done right prices fall, competition increases, and government expenditures are redirected to more important things. When a deregulation is done wrong prices don't fall and the government monopoly is simply taken over by a private firm. A lot of things benefited greatly from deregulation, not all things.

I do have to ask, though... How did the deregulation of industries lead to income inequality?

Income inequality, in my opinion is partially result of deindustrialization and offshoring. I don't believe that deindustrialization is a function of deregulation or other <&quot;>neoliberal<&quot;> programs, but rather a function of technology change in transportation and telecommunications making it possible to offshore effectively for the first time. American factories produce more output than any other country except China, and even then it's not all that different. It's just that American factories went from a place where unskilled workers made anything to a place were highly skilled workers made only the highest value industrial products. The unskilled jobs were moved to places where labor was cheap, benefitting everyone (the workers in the third world, investors, and consumers) except the people who depended upon the first step of an unskilled factory job as a means to getting to better jobs in the future. This left college as the primary means of getting to better jobs.

Another major vector for income inequality is increasing need for the highest quality executives. You have the example of new industries coming into existence in short periods of time since the early 1980's. The only way of getting executives, by grooming them through middle management over a period of a decade or two, has broken down entirely. Many large companies haven't existed for decades. Most people don't work for companies for decades. So, those proven executives are constantly being head hunted and are the subject of a bidding war. Many companies that lost that bidding war find themselves sitting on very large piles of money without the vision or organization to make the big investment or embark on new development. I would argue that executive incomes could be brought into line by simply figuring a way to provide experience to more potential upper level managers. Once the biggest need of these companies are filled then more resources would be available for the enlarging and remunerating the rest of the workforce.

The World Bank, IMF, and WTO don't represent the ideals of Friedman or Hayek, but tend to require interventionism in a different way. Their requirements are generally focused on requiring governments to service loans and enforce treaty obligations than foster growth or improve anyone's balance sheet. I agree that they dicked over the third world, but to argue that they are neoliberal is absurd because their behavior belies a hyperfocus on repayment over everything else.

The debt crisis isn't a case against deregulation, mostly because the things that went bust were either actively subsidized by government programs (housing through Fannie and Freddy, ensuring all people had homes was a political objective and the subject of government intervention) or never regulated in the first place (credit default swaps). The Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980's was a case against a poorly designed and thought out case of deregulation, though.

I do have to point out that Friedman and Hayek both say that a company that applies market power to receive perks is a bad thing. They argue for many small actors, and if large actors seek special treatment you should let them go. Corporate welfare is an anathema to their arguments.

I would argue that there hasn't been a dominant style.

1swelx,ce1xjeb,ce1wac2,"Thanks for your reply! I should have emphasized in my original post that, in my conception, although neoliberalism began with Hayek and Freidmann at the Chicago school, it has been at many points contradictory to their ideas and been constantly evolving. Therefore, I wouldn't take neoliberalism as an exact extension of the Chicago school ideas but rather as (not my words) *the mobilization of state power in the contradictory extension and reproduction of market(-like) rule.* This involves deregulation but not just deregulation, I apologize if my original definition was poor.

1. I agree that offshoring was more of a technological shift than an outcome of deregulation, but I would argue that offshoring is essentially a neoliberal process as it dismantles the mass production/mass consumption model in order to exploit geographic differences in labor and resource costs (China). This resulted in those unskilled workers who depended on unskilled jobs falling onto welfare, prison, and other arms of the state. Those who used to be taken care of by the companies were forced to rely on the state, which fits in with my definition above. 

2. The executive headhunting argument is interesting and new to me and I agree with it. However, I would argue that  it is necessary to question why banks now have the resources to pay executives so astronomically, not just why they do so. I believe this is a result of deregulation that allowed financial firms to risk/leverage more and take riskier bets. While this has proved very beneficial to them, it has caused a number of large and small financial crises that increase income inequality.

3. I disagree with you most pointedly on the nature of the Structural Adjustment Programs issued by the IMF. Even if the organizations themselves were not neoliberal, the nature of the changes they sought to impose was. Unilaterally they sought to reduce state power, open the countries to foreign direct investment, exploit spatial divisions of labor (export oriented production zones), and keep themselves in a position of power. While they may have had an explicit focus on repayment, they had an implicit political focus: to ensure that LDCs went full free market as to preserve global hegemonies of power.

4. With the debt crisis, can you explain how something never being regulated in the first place (credit default swaps) is not a problem of deregulation? There is no one reason for the crisis but I think the lack of oversight on these financial instruments and others definitely helped push things over the edge.

1) I don't think that this was an intentional process. I think that the movement of manufacturing from the rust belt to the sun belt during and after the Second World War was simply continued and was extended to overseas for the same reasons that business began to move from Detroit to Alabama in the first place. Moreover, many of the welfare systems had just been created during the Great Society push, so wouldn't the <&quot;>pushing people into welfare<&quot;> simply be an extension of Great Society programs. Those things have largely remained untouched since. There was never a <&quot;>rollback<&quot;> of welfare.

2) Who said banks? It's a feature of everything down to nonprofits, even though they are penalized by the IRS for doing so. Stop with the mono-focus, it's not all about the financial markets. The entirety of the American Economy is suffering from a crippling lack of leadership and no clear path to the sort of entrepreneurship that would replace the jobs gradually lost to offshoring and technology change.

3) They originally sought to ensure solvency to repay the loan by the sale of state assets. It was under the guise of opening up markets, but the assets sold were marketed to those interested in harvesting the assets, not investing in them. It's all about the loan, not ideology. There's nothing good about selling a productive facility only for it to be parted out, and no one seeking to create a market would do that.

If you are seeking to preserve power, you cannot be talking free market. The market doesn't care about power. The market doesn't care about anything. The market doesn't care about you. I agree that the IMF and the like are there to preserve global power hegemonies, I would even call the neocolonial, but I wouldn't class it as the sort of thing that anyone interested in a free market would push. It's functionally the opposite of globalism.

4) How can it be deregulated if there was any regulation to begin with? More accurately, there were three agencies nominally responsible for them but there were no guidelines issued and reporting was voluntary. There was a critical lapse of oversight, but the credit default swap has been around since the 40's. Deregulation was irrelevant to the lack of oversight in this case. 

Unlike the Savings and Loans scandals, Enron (how they made that money in the first place), the proliferation of Ponzi schemes, or the creative accounting scandals (like how Enron fell apart). Those were issues of failures or improper deregulation.

I agree with you that current US spending is damaging. However, it is not spending itself that is a problem, rather what the money is spent on. The market/economy does not discriminate against where the money comes from.

Money spent that goes towards the top is bad for the economy as it just sits there (the rich only spend a small percentage of their money). Money spent that goes towards the lower and middle class is good for the economy as it gets spent. The health of an economy depends on one thing, money moving around. Any amount of money is useless for the economy if it is not being used. 

At the same time where the money comes from is important. Since the poor spend all their money, taxing them and spending that money does not achieve much. You get the best results for the economy by taxing money that would have otherwise go unspent. 

The single best thing a government can spend money on is infrastructure, on the condition that you use local workers and source local materials. It helps immensely if the government itself runs things instead of contracting it out, since the contracting company takes a large cut. The reason infrastructure spending like this is the best is rather simple, you are distributing money to the working class, who are going to spend it. At the same time you get something out of it, roads, bridges etc. It is essentially welfare, but you don't have bridges and roads falling apart. 

The way it works in the US however is corporate interests get involved, everything gets contracted out. If the government spends $10b on building roads, only a fraction of that actually goes to workers. A decent size portion is taken out by all the contracting companies involved. 

So in conclusion, the way the US government spends money is the problem. From the perspective of economic benefit, money going towards workers is better, however since the US has the 'private is always better' point of view, a considerable portion of government spending gets filtered out of the economy by the extremely wealthy taking their cut.  

Of course you have to balance things by what is 'fair'. From the perspective of what is best for the economy, you would only tax the wealthy and you would tax them a lot. After all what you are looking for is money that would have gone unspent, you don't get any of that from the working classes. Since people, especially the rich, don't like that you have to strike a balance. The US has a strong anti-redistribution sentiment, so government spending can never be as an efficient means of economic stimulus compared to countries that tax the wealthy more. 

When it comes down to it the problem is those with wealth and power want to maintain it and they are using their wealth to do so. They have convinced a considerable number of Americans that the best thing for the economy is that they get to keep as much of their money as they can because they will share some of it. They have a handle on government which gives them policy that reflects what is best for them, not what is best for the country as a whole.",IizPyrate,CC,2,,19

1swelx,ce2kefg,ce1wac2,"I need to question the premise that you begin with.

&gt;If Freidman and Hayek really had all that power then why are a majority of economists and politicians Neokeynesian?

This appears to have many fallacies packed into one statement.  Ideas prosper of their own merit, no matter who proposes them.  One requires no authority for a meritorious idea to survive, and to argue otherwise is an implicit appeal to authority.  We might further state that for those not democratically elected, authority is derived from expertise built upon with ideas.  Einstein wasn't elected, nor was he born an authority on any subject matter, for example.

Making statements about the majority of economists is a hasty generalization fallacy, and in this case it neglects the truth that those who are economists by profession study *all* economic theories.  Their personal ideals do not matter, as when they are consulted by policy-makers, their advice is sought in the context of a predetermined goal.

Further, these are not diametrically opposed philosophies.  In fact, it's a misconception to hold that any two economic theories can not coexist.  If industries or geographic regions are compartmentalized then multiple schools of thought may be applied, each to their most beneficial purpose.

1tku2p,ce9upxm,1tku2p,"Some simple corrections to the data show that that's largely due to demographic factors, especially the fact that the US takes in an enormous number of refugees, arriving with no prior education and little if any English.  [Her's a brilliant discussion of it](http://super-economy.blogspot.com.au/2010/12/amazing-truth-about-pisa-scores-usa.html)

You'll notice that just by restricting our comparison to Americans of European ancestry (less than 70% of the population) to non-immigrants in Europe, the USA instantly jumps comfortably into the top third, beating most of Western Europe.

On a related note, many people have mentioned East Asian countries.  I went to a school in Australia that was about 80% Asian and believe me, their families have a VERY different attitude towards studying.  Perhaps Asian schools aren't better, they just have the benefit of having all of their students go home to Asian families.  Indeed, if we compare the results of Asian students in the US to those in Asia, it's a tie!  Looks like their schools aren't inherently better at all.

You'll notice that just by restricting our comparison to Americans of European ancestry (less than 70% of the population) to non-immigrants in Europe, the USA instantly jumps comfortably into the top third, beating most of Western Europe.

On a related note, many people have mentioned East Asian countries.  I went to a school in Australia that was about 80% Asian and believe me, their families have a VERY different attitude towards studying.  Perhaps Asian schools aren't better, they just have the benefit of having all of their students go home to Asian families.

1ucgh6,cego3xv,1ucgh6,"Let me give you reasons to care:  

- Although it's <&quot;>cool<&quot;> to provoke strange or dirty looks, you might one day need the respect from these people: potential employers, parents-in-law, girlfriends, etc.  
- The planet is a delicate balance of ecosystems achieved by millions of years of evolution to get to this point (and there is a lot to come).  We humans recently evolved *within* this ecosystem and adapted to it, so we should be interested in preserving it or at least not be unnecessarily destructive (very broad statement there, but let's leave that one aside) towards it.  
- Some of these animals are particularly fascinating to some people, so you will see more attention given to the panda and tigers than to certain frogs and moths.  In my case as a non-motorized pilot I have a great fascination towards condors, so I have a personal interesting in keeping them around.  I would ask you to respect that by caring a bit.  Your care makes the jobs of those that are doing something about it easier (so you don't need to do anything except hope they don't disappear as a gesture towards people like me).  
- Some people find it very important to leave the planet in the best (preserved) condition as possible for their children to experience it as untampered as possible.  If, like me, you don't have children you might not feel this directly, but do you respect others that do?  I do and I am not the weaker or less cool for it.   

Other than that, 99% of the species that have ever existed have gone extinct, and it almost happened to us humans, and it will happen to millions of species from now on so the attachment is as emotional as it is rational, but do not underestimate emotions as they are a driver of society.  That cool thrill you get when showing off how naughty you are for not caring about my beloved condor is as valid as the emotion I feel when flying next to one.

If, like me, you don't have children you might not feel this directly, but do you respect others that do? I do and I am not the weaker or less cool for it.

I do want these animals to thrive and have a stronger ecosystem but I don't have a big heart for it.",BasedFuccboi,RE,3,,41

1ucgh6,cegwl5y,1ucgh6,"**Extinction in general:**

One of the absolute most precious resources in the world is *useful genetic material*. Each species has a unique set of genes which code proteins, some of which may exist nowhere else on Earth.

They have come about through millions of years of evolution, a process infinitely too costly to duplicate in a lab. We don't know how to make new proteins from scratch. But, when we need drugs that interact harmoniously with our body in complex, subtle ways, it's often proteins and other organic compounds that do the trick.

Those compounds are often discovered by doing research on organisms in nature. When we let species die, we are shrinking the pool of resources we can pull from to discover new medicine.

**Biodiversity:**

Another thing to keep in mind is how biodiversity handles changes in the environment. Diversity is equivalent to *flexibility*. When you have a bunch of different living organisms, if the underlying environment changes, there's a good chance there's something around that can survive.

The less diversity you have, the less you can respond to changes. Given how quickly *we* change the environment, it's in our best interest to make sure we still have animals that can survive for us to use after we've done that.

**Big ticket endangered animals:**

Of course, you're right that people spend too much time worrying about the most interesting endangered animals. Big ones like condors, or particularly cuddly ones get tons of protection while nearly existing fungi and bugs get nothing.

That isn't ideal, but I do think there is marketing value in keeping these animals that are particularly appealing to people around. I hope you agree that having lots of animals and a thriving natural ecosystem is important *in general*. We'd have a hard time finding enough food if we paved over the whole planet and, and I doubt many people would be happy living in a completely lifeless concrete wasteland.

Since most people vote or can otherwise influence policies that affect nature, it's good to encourage them to care about the environment. If caring about condors gets people caring about the whole forest where those condors live, that's a good thing.

I feel the same way about zoos. Some people say animals in zoos would be happier if they were in the wild. Maybe, but lots of people live in cities and don't have easy access to nature. If we closed all the zoos, many of those people would never see an animal in person that isn't on their dinner plate. I can't imagine those people caring to vote for wildlife preserves and natural forests if its something they have no first-hand experience.

Zoos works like an empathy generator for the entire natural environment. The animals forced to live in zoos are a proxy for *all* of the animals in the world.",munificent,CC,5,,37

In a way I am just asking you to change your statement.  You might think just changing one's words and not actions is hypocritical, and I might agree, but there is more to it than that.

Now, I don't have a solution to the problem immediately at hand, mainly because the people who own these vacant houses would be APPALLED at the idea of using them to house the homeless on their own dime, or worse, paying a dollar more in taxes to subsidize housing for the poor. But I do think that capitalism falls apart as an efficient means of distributing wealth when goods and services become post-scarcity, and that is evidently what we are seeing today. If we have the ability to throw away food because it doesn't look as good as other foods, or to have vacant houses with nobody to move into them, then we've passed the scarcity point of these things, and we apparently need a better system.

1ucj9u,cegopcd,1ucj9u,"&gt;Until there is, until you actually have that method and system figured out, it is completely useless to bring it up at all.

So unless you've come up with a solution to a problem, bringing up that there is a problem is useless? I'm sorry, but bullshit. We don't solve problems in real life by ignoring them or sweeping them under the rug, we solve them by gathering people together to think about the problem, define the problem, and find creative solutions.

1ucj9u,cegscal,1ucj9u,"I want to talk about your view on forums of debate in general.  I come from a college debate background (and so I naturally want to defend it), and I think that debate does have real life applications that go above and beyond abstract space arguments.

First, at least in high school and college debate activities, the feasibility of whether something can be implemented is a **huge** aspect of whether or not it will ultimately be considered a good argument.  If I were to propose that the United States should, now and forever, prevent all genocides, I would get responses like the fact that we often can't because we don't have troops on the ground and getting troops on the ground is politically impossible short of an invasion in most situations; that the costs of monitoring for and then invading in all of these situations would be huge and might limit us from doing other reasonable things, like feeding the hungry and curing diseases; that there is no way for either politicians or the public to be on board in the long run for so many invasions that are often counter to US interests; and many arguments about rights and backlash that are separate from whether it can be implemented reasonably.  In fact, policy debate leagues make implementation a core part of who wins the round. So I think that the argument about what <&quot;>should<&quot;> be versus what <&quot;>can<&quot;> happen is not as true as you seem to think it is.

Second, I think the core of what you are talking about-- abstract arguments versus dealing with the political realities of a situation-- are more of a human concept than a debating concept.  I would argue that it is very, very easy to accept that things can be better, and that it is much harder to go through and nitpick all of the individual ways that it can fail.  Since people often develop their beliefs and politics at a relatively early age, or from their parents, or from something that wasn't deep research or evidence based discussion, these easy idealisms become entrenched for them.  In fact, I think that the only way to get people to care more about whether something is feasible and how to achieve it than <&quot;>castle in the sky<&quot;> beliefs is through discussions to show them what happens in reality, and try to convince and persuade them to change their view.  Only then, through debate and debate communities, do you truly convince people to be more grounded in reality versus what they, in their heart of hearts, want to believe.

Finally, I think that debating and debating communities have intrinsic value.  Imagine, for a moment, that people did as you say and believed that discussions of politics and policy weren't useful, so they no longer sought them out or participated in them.  I think you would end up with far fewer situations where someone gets introduced to new facts that help change their mind, or to contradictions in their beliefs.  Further, I would argue that the best way to foster logic based beliefs is to force people to defend them logically to others, so even if you don't believe you can change others' opinions, you should still believe that you can improve your own, personal opinions by having to defend them.

Hopefully this helps convince you that debate communities have at least some merit, and that the problems you are talking about are true of people's beliefs generally.",AFKennedy,CC,6,,37

Since people often develop their beliefs and politics at a relatively early age, or from their parents, or from something that wasn't deep research or evidence based discussion, these easy idealisms become entrenched for them.  In fact, I think that the only way to get people to care more about whether something is feasible and how to achieve it than <&quot;>castle in the sky<&quot;> beliefs is through discussions to show them what happens in reality, and try to convince and persuade them to change their view.  Only then, through debate and debate communities, do you truly convince people to be more grounded in reality versus what they, in their heart of hearts, want to believe.

Finally, I think that debating and debating communities have intrinsic value.  Imagine, for a moment, that people did as you say and believed that discussions of politics and policy weren't useful, so they no longer sought them out or participated in them.  I think you would end up with far fewer situations where someone gets introduced to new facts that help change their mind, or to contradictions in their beliefs.  Further, I would argue that the best way to foster logic based beliefs is to force people to defend them logically to others, so even if you don't believe you can change others' opinions, you should still believe that you can improve your own, personal opinions by having to defend them.

Hopefully this helps convince you that debate communities have at least some merit, and that the problems you are talking about are true of people's beliefs generally.",AFKennedy,CC,4,,38
1ucj9u,cegscal,1ucj9u,"I want to talk about your view on forums of debate in general.  I come from a college debate background (and so I naturally want to defend it), and I think that debate does have real life applications that go above and beyond abstract space arguments.

First, at least in high school and college debate activities, the feasibility of whether something can be implemented is a **huge** aspect of whether or not it will ultimately be considered a good argument.  If I were to propose that the United States should, now and forever, prevent all genocides, I would get responses like the fact that we often can't because we don't have troops on the ground and getting troops on the ground is politically impossible short of an invasion in most situations; that the costs of monitoring for and then invading in all of these situations would be huge and might limit us from doing other reasonable things, like feeding the hungry and curing diseases; that there is no way for either politicians or the public to be on board in the long run for so many invasions that are often counter to US interests; and many arguments about rights and backlash that are separate from whether it can be implemented reasonably.  In fact, policy debate leagues make implementation a core part of who wins the round. So I think that the argument about what <&quot;>should<&quot;> be versus what <&quot;>can<&quot;> happen is not as true as you seem to think it is.

He drew 2 circles, one named the Circle of Concern, the other called the Circle of Influence.  The two circles have the same center - you - and one always contains the other.  The idea is that people have things they are concerned about, and they also have some power to influence and change things.

When the Circle of Concern contains the Circle of Influence and is much larger than the Circle of Influence, you have relatively powerless people, worrying, debating and endlessly arguing over things that they have no ability to have any influence over.  

When the Circle of Influence is much larger than the Circle of Concern, here you have a powerful person who doesn't care about the effects of his decisions.  This kind of person doesn't spend much time talking but can cause great harm.

Realpolitik is a concept advanced most famously by Otto Von Bismarck, who said **<&quot;>Politics is the art of the possible.<&quot;>**  Politicians who embrace realpolitik tend to get shit done.  The problem is they also tend to be the politicians whom give politicians a bad name.

The other problem with realpolitiks is that without a clearly visualized, ideal end goal or state to focus on -- a vision of how government and society should be -- realpolitiks tends to break down into politicians doing whatever they can to take and hold power.  

Imagine a politician who exists only to get elected over and over; he has no goals other than to survive the next election.  Is this a good statesmen?  Does this inspire you?  Of course not.  But that's what a realpolitik player becomes when he doesn't have idealists shaping the vision of his political coalition.

Hence, you need the **Idealists**.  The people who have completely impractical and possibly unrealizable visions of possible futures.  People who can clearly articulate what the **point** of politics should be.

1wnhk1,cf3pz89,1wnhk1,"&gt; I have not been vaccinated for the flu virus in 12 years. When I did receive the vaccination I was sick for a week and a half after and was bedridden.

Just to make it clear- you did not have the flu but had a different infection resulting from a temporary weakened immune system while your body was creating antibodies to the vaccine.

&gt; This has turned me off to receiving the shot, and I have had zero complications since with the flu.

You have been lucky- if you are young and in general good health, you getting the flu will *probably* be just a big inconvenience. But for those who are in high risk groups (elderly, immuno-compromised, children, etc.) the flu can be a death sentence, as you point out the number that die each year. I advise you to read up on herd immunity [Link](http://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection)

&gt; Annually 3,300 - 49,000 people die from the flu. There are no statistics I've seen which show how many of these people were vaccinated and which weren't. 

The flu vaccine has ~60% effective rate in these high risk populations (According to a 2010 Cochrane meta-analysis). <&quot;>In a 2010 Cochrane meta-analysis of three randomized trials of inactivated influenza vaccines in elderly individuals, the vaccines were 58 percent effective against influenza<&quot;>. What this means is that although many receive the flu vaccine each year, many people do not adequately form an immune response. This makes the notion that those who are more at risk of spreading and propagating the virus (you and I) should be immunized as well in order to decrease the degree to which it spreads.
 
&gt; There are several strains of the flu and it is not 100% that you'll receive the correct matching vaccination although it is probably higher than 50%.

This is only partly correct. There are several strains of the flu. The H &amp; Ns that you hear about are different variations of proteins that the flu uses to have virulence. Vaccines are targeted towards these and other proteins and as these are consistently changing, the vaccine needs to change from year to year as well. These new strains arise from other species' flu viruses (birds [avian] and pigs [swine]) and cross over to infect humans making it necessary to produce new vaccines. What the vaccine attempts to do is look at the more prevalent flu strains and predict to a certain degree what strains are going to be the most deadly/debilitating. So is the vaccine 100% effective? No. But not much in medicine is and by you not getting vaccinated, you put many in society at greater risk.

Here are some interesting facts about the flu vaccine:

*  <&quot;>In that study, researchers from the Netherlands reported that influenza vaccination was associated with a 50% reduction in deaths among people aged 65 and over. Vaccination was also credited with reducing deaths by 78% among younger, high-risk adults, such as those with chronic heart or lung diseases.<&quot;> [Link](http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20050214/do-flu-shots-save-lives)

Um, no. 

From the CDC... <&quot;>**The most common reaction to the flu shot in adults has been soreness, redness or swelling at the spot where the shot was given**. This usually lasts less than **two days**. This initial soreness is most likely the result of the body's early immune response reacting to a foreign substance entering the body. Other reactions following the flu shot are usually **mild** and can include a low grade fever and aches. If these reactions occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and **last 1-2 days**.<&quot;>

&gt; If you are going to attribute a 10 day illness as being due to a separate infection then in the case of a bacterial infection this should warrant a course of antibiotics, which most people do not support.

It is more likely a viral infection and as such would not warrant antibiotics. Also, depending on the bacterial species antibiotics may or may not be indicated. And I am unsure what you mean by <&quot;>most people do not support<&quot;>- are you in the medical field and understand the indications for antibiotics?

&gt; what makes it a severe reaction.

Again, from the CDC...<&quot;>Life-threatening allergic reactions are very rare. Signs of serious allergic reaction can include breathing problems, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness. **If they do occur, it is within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot.** These reactions are more likely to occur among persons with a severe allergy to eggs, because the viruses used in most influenza vaccines are grown in hensÇƒˆ?—?• eggs. While severe reactions are uncommon, you should let your doctor, nurse, clinic, or pharmacist know if you have a history of allergy or severe reaction to flu vaccine or any part of flu vaccine, including eggs.<&quot;>

1ynn2z,cfmqslb,cfmggm5,"The thing is, nuclear power shoudn't be dangerous. When you look at what led to atomic accidents, it seems completely unreasonable. 

Chern? Pulling out almost all the control rods? Unplugging critical equipment to test conditions of a meltdown **in the middle of the night?** Making last minute changes to an extremely dangerous test without contacting higher-ups? Having an extremely flawed control system that increases the rate of reaction **because it is partially made of graphite, which promotes chain reactions?**

In Fukushima and Three Mile Island, there too was serious human error. In Fukushima, a dent in the reactor chamber was casually ignored. Inspectors were incredibly lax, and numerous safety programs, like robots to work in radioactive zones, were cut. Fukishima didn't even follow basic international and national safety guidelines, because of long standing tradition of hiring ex-regulators into private companies.

Whenever I play a game like Wastelands 2 or Xenonauts (these are the two that spring to mind, though I've played others) and finally get to the combat, I feel like the game grinds to a halt. This happens with any sort of turn based combat in RPG games. I should point out that Grand-Strategy games like Civ or Total War are not what I'm talking about here. The games themselves aren't what's boring. I thought that the two I mentioned above had cool premises and were super detailed in lore, two things I love about games. But when the combat started, the nice flow that I had been experiencing stops. I'll try and list the things that bother me.

1. Action Points: I get the reasoning behind them but they limit what I want to do so badly I want to throw my computer out the window. They simply seem unrealistic.

2. Enemies: Perhaps it's because I never played long enough to get better equipment, but every time I play and try to attack I always miss at point blank range. However at 100 yards the enemy seems to be a dead eye with every shot.

3. Turns: Things will happen to my guys on an enemy turn that I can't react to like I would in Age of Empires, Company of Heroes, etc... and it seems unrealistic. One time I was playing Xenonats and the aliens made one of my soldiers go nuts and started shooting everyone. IRL and in RTS games you'd move your guys away and try to kill the crazed soldier, but nope, I had to sit there and watch three of my guys get slaughtered because it was the <&quot;>Enemy Turn<&quot;>.

I know I'll probably get responses like, <&quot;>Oh well you just haven't played them enough<&quot;> or <&quot;>You sound like you don't know what you're doing<&quot;>. Which are both true, but the games make me so mad that I don't want to even try and get better. In an RTS if I accidentally lose my tank to an enemy emplacement, that's my fault and I should have been paying attention more to the situation. But it could have happened in a split second, far to fast for me to react, and that doesn't bother me because shit happens like that IRW all the time. In a turn based game if I miss it, I have to sit there and watch helplessly as the enemy takes it out and I watch the camera hover over the wreckage as if to say <&quot;>Look dumb-ass, ya coulda stopped it, but you got too frustrated.<&quot;>

I do really want to have my view changed on this.

2. Everything comes down to stats, not logic. You're trying to sway the RNG in your favor with accuracy and evasion stats. It's kind of a cross between preparation/tactics and luck.

3. If you don't like turns, then there's not much I can say to defend turn-based combat. Yeah, you can't always prepare or predict what the enemy will do while you have the chance. But that's part of the fun of it, frankly.

Besides all that, turn-based combat keeps things at a more 'casual' pace without destroying tension. It also takes away a lot of skill in favor of preparation and rewarding your efforts.

2a5fi8,ciro19q,2a5fi8,"I'll deal with number 3, because I think it may be the most pertinent (also what I say may apply to number 2, as well).

Part of the fun in turn-based strategy (and I'm sure other turn-based combat systems) games is *prediction* and *manipulation* of the RNG which determines the actions of your opponent.  The example that first comes to mind for me is XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within.  XCOM is a turn-based combat game that makes you rely on prediction of how the computer is going to work to win.  The fact that you cannot do anything once the enemy has attacked is precisely the point.  What you are intended to do is maneuver it so that the enemy *can't* attack, or can't attack in any meaningful way.  In XCOM, especially on the harder difficulties, if the enemy has a chance to get a shot off *at all* it almost always spells demise for your soldiers, especially in the early game.  What a skilled player will do is make it so their soldiers are always just out of the line of sight, or sitting in sight but with a high enough defense rating to make an enemy shot exceedingly unlikely.

As far as I'm concerned, this isn't a skill that can be taught especially well.  It's a skill that you will have to learn through trial and error and through playing a game enough where you can get a hold of the system and manipulate it so that you don't lose.  To me, that's what the fun is in these games.  The background story elements and characters are so much set dressing; the real fun of the game is taking apart a system and figuring out how to exploit it so that you will be able to beat it at its own game.",MackDaddyVelli,CC,5,"Attacking the logic, opinion on why such games are fun

I haven't gotten too in-depth into the TBS genre (to be honest, I've only really played a handful and have played neither of the games you mentioned in your OP), but if you're still interested in getting into it try getting XCOM: Enemy Unknown and starting off on the regular difficulty level.  It's got a pretty good tutorial and then it really throws you in, but it's all about learning maps and learning how to manipulate the system, and once you've got that down it's challenging but rewarding.

Another TBS series that I've been a fan of for quite some time (it's really the only other TBS games I've ever played, but I've been playing them for quite some time) is Fire Emblem.  It's a fantasy TBS and has a combat system that, in my opinion, is quite limited in scope (having only a handful of character types) but at the same time robust and provides an almost extraordinary amount of difficulty.  It also has permadeath of characters that have names, personalities, motivations, etc (although this can be turned off in the most recent installment, Awakening), which creates an interesting incentive to preserve your characters not just because they are effective fighters that are strong against enemy units x, y, and z, but also because they are characters with names and personalities and the option for flavor text between missions.",MackDaddyVelli,CC,3,,40

[Frozen Synapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jJrUY27O0Y) is turn based in that you and your opponent both plan out your troop's actions and then have them be carried out simultaneously.

2aoqud,2aoqud,2aoqud,"CMV: I believe the use of <&quot;>you white people<&quot;> as an all encompassing pejorative to establish the relative wrong doing of historical white america is inherently incorrect.. This CMV comes from a thread in /r/offmychest titled <&quot;>White people... and the Black Experience.<&quot;> I posted this in response in hopes of creating some dialogue, but to no avail. 

To preface this - I am a late 20 something Jewish <&quot;>white<&quot;> girl from Brooklyn, NY. I did not grow up in what is now being called the modern day <&quot;>white culture<&quot;> but in a pretty isolated Jewish culture in the 80s and 90s - which is vastly different from each other. My family did not come to this country until the mid 1900s from the Ukraine and Poland - victims of pogroms and the Holocaust. My family; My parents parents, and their parents parents, and their parents parents going all the way back have never been involved with slavery, apartheid, massacres or wars. In fact we come from a small shtetl that had been able to stay far removed from these events up until the turn of the last century.  

Now to the point of my spiel and where my issue comes in. While I certainly believe in much of what entails the modern day black experience - the cultural appropriations by people, the glass ceiling, the casual racism - I object to the grouping of <&quot;>white people<&quot;> as if my family's heritage means nothing because we share the same general skin tone. I have never, nor do I come from ancestry, who perpetrated such horrible sins on black people, on their families or on their ancestors.  

When I speak about Israel - I often get responses like <&quot;>well you white Americans massacred the Native Americans and enslaved people so you have no right to speak on such issues.<&quot;> This is just an argumentum ad hominem fallacy, and it makes it easier to attack me personally to further their own claims, even though I and my ancestors could not be further from this. And it's the truth on this topic as well. I don't bare the weight of historical slavery and mistreatment on my shoulders - even though I am white. It is not my burden to carry. I ache for those who lived through it, who carry the scars, and whose children are still dealing with the repercussions in our modern day era - but I am not your oppressor and I don't come from an ancestral family of oppressors, these events do not reflect on me. In fact, I come from the exact opposite - from a group of people who used to be known as the eternal victims. If the modern day argument to this is that you move to a country and become a citizen - you then inherit that countries history as well - then this would negate everything I say, but I would disagree with that sentiment.  I can only personally affirm that I am not a racist, I don't ever use the N word, have never appropriated a part of your culture (be it braids, saying <&quot;>she has a black ass<&quot;> to twerking) and I would fight for your rights if I was needed - and I hope you would do the same for me.  

Now to another point about white privilege. In America there is undoubtedly white privilege. I certainly saw it growing up in NYC, and I definitely see it here in Washington, DC. If there is anything I could be guilty of it is living in a society where white privilege is rampant and I have had the ability to take advantage of it without even really knowing it. But I am still fighting for the privileges that I don't have - to be LGBT, to be a woman who controls my own body, also to be Jewish freely.

Using <&quot;>white people<&quot;> as a pejorative is something that I do not agree with. CMV

2aoqud,cix99is,2aoqud,"As a fellow Jewish Long Islander of the 80s/90s whose family only came here in the early 1900s I figure my perspective might make some sense to you.

&gt; When I speak about Israel - I often get responses like <&quot;>well you white Americans massacred the Native Americans and enslaved people so you have no right to speak on such issues.<&quot;> This is just an argumentum ad hominem fallacy, and it makes it easier to attack me personally to further their own claims, even though I and my ancestors could not be further from this.

I agree with you on this partially. A response like that is completely argumentum ad hominem and honestly not worth discussing with people who make that argument. Granted, if what you are saying portrays the level of ignorance that is known of Americans and results from this type of situation and oppression, then it's likely someone responding emotionally to you rather than pointing out where your argument may fall flat. 

&gt; I don't bare the weight of historical slavery and mistreatment on my shoulders - even though I am white. It is not my burden to carry.

You mention that you agree that white privilege exists, you've seen it! The point here is that though you do not bare the weight of historical slavery and mistreatment on your shoulders, as a white person in the US right now you *benefit* from that historical situation through white privilege. Even though your family and ancestors were not involved in it directly at all, you currently benefit from the social order and situation that was set up as a result of that historical slavery and mistreatment and as such you need to be aware of it just as you agree that people should be aware of white privilege, because that's all that is being talked about.

In the same way that though I've never personally participated in any oppression of women or LGBT people, I still benefit in society from the fact that I am a straight male and have to recognize this. Anyone who is explicitly stating that you should feel guilty for what happened in the past or that you have no right to have any opinion whatsoever at all, is missing the point and is wrong.

2aoqud,cixd6cu,cixc9u8,"Regarding the <&quot;>you white people<&quot;> part of the your post:

Correct, in the case of your family it can be said that given their history, they truly can claim that they have no relationship to the horrors of racism, and that thus the blanket term of <&quot;>you white people<&quot;> is inherently unfair. The issue with this is two-fold

On the one hand, there is the fact that the term <&quot;>white people<&quot;> is on that has evolved over the ages. White people shortly after slavery were almost exclusively people that could trace their lineage to countries like England. Even if you were Irish, or certainly if you were Jewish, <&quot;>white people<&quot;> would very much object to you calling yourself part of their society. Over time, the term evolved and began to include minorities previously excluded, to the point where many people even consider Jewish people as white, whilst in the past that would have been unthinkable.

Following that period of slavery, <&quot;>white people<&quot;> really were the main group that had kept black society down. They were overwhelmingly the wealthy owners of land and keepers of slaves, and they were integrated at every level of society. But, whilst the term <&quot;>white people<&quot;> evolved to integrate more groups, the need to call out white society for its transgressions did not disappear. So when talking about how <&quot;>you white people<&quot;> are responsible for this or that, you're largely dealing with a very complex problem of language.

That brings us to the second issue though, the irrelevance of your guilt. You are not guilty, nor is your family guilty from what you told me, of racism in America. The issue though when discussing racism in America, and the responsibility of white society for it, we are dealing with large groups and forces, on a nation-wide level.

When for example discussing how white society impacted black society, its easy to call out that you are innocent, and you are not guilty. That however, means missing the issue. Sure, you are innocent, and so likely is your family, but the issue with that is that you're making the issue very small, personal, and focusing it on yourself, whilst the discussion is often about large and great forces, where we speak in terms of <&quot;>white people<&quot;> and <&quot;>black people<&quot;>.

I think you bring up several really good points, but would just like to expand a little on some of the things you touched on and offer my experience and perspective.

I'm currently living and attending school in a city that is predominately white and my school is a liberal arts school with ~90 Black students, and even less of other non-White groups out of a ~3,500 student body. Coming from a much larger city and school where I was surrounded by much more racial diversity and making the transition to being the only person of color almost everywhere I go has been an extreme adjustment. Even though a lot of my friend groups since high school have been largely white just due to similar interests, I was never the *only* non-white person in class, at work, at a restaurant, just walking down the street. I also study sociology which has made me even more acutely aware of things like race and white privilege. 

Now, I do say things like <&quot;>ugh, white people<&quot;> in a tongue-in-cheek way or reference [White People Fatigue Syndrome] (http://www.julietdavis.com/COM443/articles/Representing%20Whiteness%20in%20the%20Black%20Imagination%20-%20bell%20hooks.pdf) as discussed by bell hooks (pg. 345-6 in link) when I've had a particularly long day or week of battling [microaggressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression), dealing with white privilege and the ignorance that that privilege affords many white people to live with blissfully. However, I completely agree that your point about people saying all white people are guilty by association in the case of slavery, Jim Crow, etc. is a fallacy, though there are definitely people who believe this. 

&gt;If there is anything I could be guilty of it is living in a society where white privilege is rampant and I have had the ability to take advantage of it without even really knowing it. 

I think this is your most important point. Being that you already acknowledge the privilege you receive being seen simply as <&quot;>White<&quot;> in America, regardless of your cultural ancestry (because clearly here things are generally simplified to white or not) is important. I know for a fact that not all White people are bad people or are unaware of their privilege, but a large number are simply oblivious, leading to a lot of casual racism or lack of acknowledgement for the role their race may play in their success while I have to work <&quot;>twice as hard to get half as far<&quot;> as they say. For me it has nothing to do with what someone's ancestors may or may not have done to my ancestors, nor does it have to do with blaming my shortcomings just on my race, but more of a sense of exhaustion with what white privilege, and thus, white people have come to represent for me as a WOC in this society and what I constantly have to battle against that others do not, through no fault of my own, but simply because of institutionalized racism. So I can see that demonizing <&quot;>white people<&quot;> as a whole is problematic, but for me it isn't about every individual White person being bad, more so that living within the system is tiring and generally a result of white privilege, which itself is a result of historical events unrelated to individual White people living today.

If someone is referring to you specifically as being oppressive, then ask what you did (and possibly why it is viewed as oppressive) and try to understand from their perspective. If someone is referring to white people in general as oppressors in regards to a particular behavior, if you don't participate in that behavior then you know they are not talking about you but rather about the fact that it is common that white people perform this particular behavior and have no reason to feel insulted. If it is something you participate in, then critically examine the behavior and recognize why and when you do it, and see if you can avoid it.",z3r0shade,CC,4,,46
